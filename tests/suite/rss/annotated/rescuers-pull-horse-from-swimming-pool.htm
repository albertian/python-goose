		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Washington's Spokane Valley Fire Department responded to an unusual call Tuesday morning after a report came out that there was a horse in a pool.

According to the homeowner their fence blew down Monday due to the high winds.

She went over to her neighbors to let them know because she feared the horse would come into their backyard. The neighbors said they did not believe Missy (the horse) would step on the wood panel fence so they were not overly concerned.
