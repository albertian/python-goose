The Scottish Football League board will meet with six representatives from the Scottish Premier League at Hampden on Tuesday in an attempt to agree on the fine details of league reconstruction in time for 2013-14. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> Celtic, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Kilmarnock and St Johnstone will negotiate with the eight SFL board members at the national stadium and try to reach a consensus on the new 12-12-18 structure.

If that can be achieved then the finalised proposals will be taken to extraordinary general meetings of both leagues.

SPL clubs will require a majority of 11-1 to approve the motion while lower league clubs would need a less prohibitive 75 per cent majority in order for the changes to be accepted.

However, hurdles remain to be cleared, not least sponsorship and television contracts for the new governing body, which will see the SPL and SFL merge for the first time since the former broke away 15 years ago.

Under the scheme already approved at a meeting by the same representatives on Dec 27, the top two leagues would split into three groups of eight clubs after 22 matches. 


The leaders, which has provisionally been dubbed the Super Eight, would compete for the title of Scottish champions and European places.

Underneath them the middle eight would compete for the right to play in the top tier the following season, with the leading four succeeding and the bottom four involved in play-offs which could see them drop into the third division.

That leaves the conundrum, yet to be satisfactorily resolved, of what happens to the first division title.

Some argue that it should be presented to the leaders after 22 games but it could yet be awarded to the winners of the 14-game mini league after the split, when four teams from the elite division will drop down.

The biggest impediment to change has always been money but it is believed that a more equitable distribution of funds throughout the senior game has already been conceded by the biggest clubs (hence the SFL abandoning their calls for a 16-club top division) and that should precipitate the process.

As Telegraph Sport revealed in August, SFA chief executive Stewart Regan anticipated that a new structure would be in place before the start of next season: that now appears increasingly likely.

That will come as good news to Falkirk manager Steven Pressley, who believes that it is the only way he can keep his bright young things at the First Division club Pressley used three 17 year-olds, three 18 year-olds and three 20 year-olds during Saturday’s 1-1 draw at Hamilton but he fears the worst unless the current system of payments is improved for smaller clubs.

“The average age of my team at Hamilton on Saturday was 19 and-a-half,” he said. “I keep beating the drum about bringing through our own players because that’s the way forward for this club.

“I hope I don’t get bids for any of my players but the problem is when you have young players performing to the levels that these guys are then it’s quite an aggressive market just now,” he said.

“They have this new Under-21 league in England and clubs are looking to fill their teams with promising talent from Scotland because they believe that they get value for money and a good level of player up here.

“I just hope we can keep hold of ours because, while it’s OK developing players and bringing them through, I want to build a winning team, one that makes our supporters exceptionally proud, and I can only do that by keeping our best assets.

“Of course, wages need to be paid every month and it’s a difficult balancing act.

“That’s why, for me, the answer isn’t selling players - it’s league reconstruction and a better redistribution of wealth.

“It would allow clubs like ours to develop players without being under pressure to sell them.”
