		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">40th Annual City of Palms Classic scores, schedule, and info</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">FORT MYERS- The 40th Annual City of Palms Classic will once again be a showcase of the best high school basketball players and teams that the nation has to offer.

Six of the top eight ranked teams in the nation are in the stacked field this year, and the tournament will feature the top-rated senior recruit in the country for the third straight year.

Huntington Prep forward Andrew Wiggins, who is highly sought after by most of the top college programs in the country, headlines an encylopedia of future college and NBA stars who will be playing in the tournament this year.

Wiggins follows Shabazz Muhammad (last year) and Austin Rivers (two years ago) as number one ranked overall recruits who have entered the City of Palms Classic with much hype early in their senior seasons.

This year's tournament also features the top-rated junior recruit in the country (Whitney Young center Jahlil Okafor) and top-rated sophomore recruit (Callaway guard Malik Newman).

Last year's City of Palms Classic champion, Prestonwood Christian (Plano, TX), returns to defend its title.

Unfortunately, fans won't be able to see the Lions' top two players in action this time.

Last year's tournament MVP, Julius Randle, recently broke his foot and will miss the entire tournament.

Randle is rated just behind Wiggins as Rivals.com's second-ranked recruit in the country.

Prestonwood Christian's other star, sophomore guard Mickey Mitchell, will also miss the tournament with a torn ACL.

Mitchell is ranked as the 4th best sophomore in the country by ESPN.

Another recent development kept Deion Sanders's Prime Prep Academy (Dallas, TX) out of the tournament.

Prime Prep left Texas's University Interscholastic League, which created a scenario that would have made it ineligible to play against some of the other teams in the City of Palms Classic.

Jacksonville's North Florida Educational Institute has replaced Prime Prep in the tournament field.

Below is this year's schedule, a list of nationally ranked teams competing in this year's Classic, and a guide of some of the highly recruited players who you'll get to see close up this year at Bishop Verot High School.

This year's tournament runs from December 18- December 22.
