		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Frankenstorm? By Hurricane Expert Jim Reif</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">If you enjoy crazy weather, grab a chair and sit down. The show is coming to a cable channel near you. If the world's two most reliable computer models are right, Hurricane Sandy's future threatens to be a part of one of the most dynamic weather patterns I've seen in more than 20 years.

Fortunately, most of what will happen is projected for early next week, after Sandy has left the Bahamas and Florida behind.

Both the GFS (American) model and ECMWF (European) model track Sandy toward the North, a few hundred miles offshore the Eastern Seaboard.

Water temperatures offshore remain about 5 degrees warmer than normal, thanks to an extra-hot summer. Despite the calendar saying late October, that water may be just warm enough to keep this hurricane energized as it travels to the mid-Atlantic coastal waters.

A very complex jet stream pattern is forecast for the Northeast US....which normally would just help a strong cold front arrive from the Midwest. But add the oddity of a late October hurricane arriving from the South, and here's where whats been dubbed "Frankenstorm": comes to life.

Computer models show the jet stream turning Sandy headlong back toward the West...and slamming directly into the mid-Atlantic coast between the Virginia capes and Long Island, NY.

So picture this --- a sopping wet storm with leftover hurricane energy....finding a new and even stronger energy source from the jet stream...and running straight toward the coast and an approaching strong cold front. If it sounds scary, it truly is.

The threat of some very heavy rains will mean serious river flooding....along with some very saturated soil.

Add in 50,60,70 mph winds...and you start losing trees (still with their leaves)...which in turn will start taking down power lines.

The full moon on Monday means higher than normal (astronomical) high tides...that may coincide with the arrival of "Frankenstorm" to produce historic tidal flooding.

Not only at the coast, but also the tidal basins of Delaware Bay and New York Harbor.

We can hope that the computer models are wrong...but if they're not, a multi-billion dollar storm may make for a scary Halloween week up North. </span>
