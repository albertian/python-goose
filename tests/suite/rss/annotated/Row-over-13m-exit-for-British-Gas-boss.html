Phil Bentley, the departing boss of British Gas, was at the centre of a row on Monday night over the financial terms of his exit amid reports that he could leave with as much as £13m. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> Mr Bentley, who earns a basic salary of £681,000 a year, has angered consumer groups by pushing through above-inflation increases that have seen average energy bills top £1,300.

He is set to depart after a strategic bust up with Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, British Gas’s parent company.

Apart from his salary, Mr Bentley could also walk away with £6.7m of share options, bonuses and a £3.6m pension pot paying £210,000 a year. Responding to claims this could add up to as much as £13m, Labour energy spokesman Tom Greatrex said: “When hard-pressed families are having their incomes squeezed it will strike many as an obscene level of reward.”

Sources close to Centrica dismissed the reports as “ludicrous”, however, disputing the £13m figure and its characterisation as a pay-off.

The controversy over Mr Bentley’s impending departure also took a surprise twist when the GMB Union voiced its support for him. 


The GMB said reports suggesting Mr Bentley was responsible for alienating staff at the energy company had “misrepresented” the positive relationship workers had with him. “Industrial relations have never been more positive,” the GMB said, adding it was “furious there has been an attempt to link a story about [Mr] Bentleys’ departure, to relations with GMB, the largest union in British Gas”.

“If [Mr] Bentley does go, then so be it, but the relationship with GMB is sound and it has been built on the basis of hard talking but also being straight and open with each other,” the GMB said.

The union said that the timing of the news of Mr Bentley’s impending departure was also of “deep concern”.

“We are in the middle of winter,” it stated. “Our members should be focused on keeping British Gas customers safe and warm. The way this has come out is impacting morale and makes no sense for the business.”

Mr Bentley, who has been running British Gas since 2007, is understood to have strategic differences with Mr Laidlaw.

Although Mr Bentley has been successful at improving British Gas’ customer service demands, Mr Laidlaw is keen for British Gas to focus on new ways to promote growth in the face of creeping regulation. The company is unveiling a strategy review at the end of February alongside results.

British Gas provides power and electricity to 12m homes around the country and employs 31,000 people.

Centrica declined to comment and Mr Bentley could not be reached.
