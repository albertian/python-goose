		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">ESTERO, FL -

    Senior Joyce Iamstrong finished a team-high 12 points as the FGCU women's basketball team has its 16-game home winning streak snapped with a 60-53 non-conference loss to UCF Saturday night at Alico Arena.

"We have to give UCF credit, they came in here and did what they had to do to get a win," said head coach Karl Smesko. "We did not shoot the ball or execute our gameplan well enough to win this game. We need to get back to work and get ready for LSU on the 28th."

With the win, UCF ended the nation's ninth-longest home winning streak, picked up their first win against the Eagles and improved to 5-8 overall, while the Green and Blue fell to 6-5 on the season.

The Eagles, who rank 16th in the nation in three-point field goals per game (7.8) this season, knocked down nine shots from behind the arc, led by two treys from Iamstrong and redshirt-seniors Betsy Adams and Lerrin Cook.

Iamstrong finished with 12 points on 5-of-11 shooting from the field and 2-of-5 from long distance. She also added six rebounds, one assist and one steal.

Redshirt junior Sarah Hansen tallied 11 points, her 10th double figure scoring performance of the season, to go with five rebounds, five assists, two blocks and one steal. Hansen with her layup at the 16:46 mark of the second half moved past former FGCU great Kate Schrader on the all-time scoring list and now sits in fourth place (1,069) behind Shannon Murphy (1,185).

FGCU will wrap up it's non-conference schedule with a Friday home match against SEC-power LSU. </span>
