Hector Sants' career can hardly have been laugh-a-minute, but the track record of the Financial Services Authority simply does not justify knighthoods or any other official honours. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> The New Year Honours list is really the Government’s New Year Favours Returned list and no knighthood reveals that more than Hector Sants’, the final chief executive of the Financial Services Authority now turned banker once again with Barclays.

To be fair, toiling in the engine room of financial services regulation from 2004, being appointed FSA chief executive in 2007, can hardly have been a laugh-a-minute career move for a highly successful former Credit Suisse investment banker.

Indeed so fed up with the job was Sants that he quit in 2010, only to have the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the blower pleading with him to stay and see through the Coalition’s regulatory shake-up, which is returning power to the Bank of England through the creation of the Prudential Regulatory Authority.

Sants duly bowed to the Chancellor’s powers of persuasion and spent a further two years in regulatory service which he finally quit in June.

His reward has duly arrived in the shape of a knighthood. 


But at its heart are two transparent contradictions. How can the Government strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood and effectively hand it to the man whose organisation failed to stop Goodwin's catastrophic ambitions in the first place?

But also, how can the Government reject the Financial Services Authority and its track record to the extent that it has passed legislation to abolish the regulatory body, yet still award its chief executive a knighthood, an honour which bestows official recognition of a job well done?

The award rings hollow, which is regrettable for Sants. But the track record of the FSA (RBS et al) simply does not justify knighthoods or any other official honours. Likewise the moves to dismantle it.

Sants has his reward elsewhere as a gamekeeper turned poacher with a new job at Barclays as head of compliance and a multi-million pound pay package. Helping clean up this organisation to change it forever would be the task worthy of a gong, not running a tarnished bureaucracy however tough the ride.
