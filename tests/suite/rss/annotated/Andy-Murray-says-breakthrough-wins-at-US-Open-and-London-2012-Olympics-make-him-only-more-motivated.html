The last time most of us saw Andy Murray on our television screens, he was laughing with mild embarrassment as he awarded himself the gold-plated trophy that commemorates third place in the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year show. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> Meanwhile Lennox Lewis, the boxer who was supposed to be making the presentation, was gazing with perplexity at the production crew. “They forgot to give him an earpiece,” Murray says, “which is quite amazing really. I felt bad for him, because he flew all the way from Jamaica to do it and he had no idea what was going on.”

Still, the BBC’s investment did not go entirely wasted. While Murray did not receive the trophy from Lewis, he took plenty of other things from his first meeting with a childhood hero.

“I watched Lennox a lot when I was growing up, so it was cool to meet him,” Murray tells Telegraph Sport. “I spoke to him for maybe 45 minutes, although I had to break off to go training in the middle. He is a legend and heavyweight boxing is the pinnacle of sport really, especially when he was fighting. So to get to pick his brains about certain things was nice.” Boxing has always been Murray’s favourite sport to follow, both because he loves its brutal simplicity and because he sees so many parallels with tennis – another sport contested in a tight, claustrophobic space with absolutely no place to hide.

David Haye is already a close friend and a valuable ally, as a sportsman who copes confidently with life in the public eye. But Lewis – a champion from boxing’s glory days – possesses an even more potent aura, and Murray has clearly been inspired by their conversation. Perhaps it will add extra venom to his own right hook as he heads into next week’s Australian Open.

“When he was boxing, they were all massive superstars,” Murray says. “It was Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, and before them you had George Foreman, Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier. The list just kind of went from one to another. 



“I asked a lot of questions about current boxers and how you train. He was saying boxing is 70 per cent mental, 30 per cent physical in the actual talent you need, and I think that applies to a lot of sports.

“The difference in how guys hit a ball is not that huge, but it’s about how you deal with the pressure moments and who can hold their nerve. When you get towards the end of sets, some guys make more mistakes than others.”

For an example of that last point, you had only to watch the way Murray dismantled the extravagantly talented Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the final of the Brisbane International. Like a crocodile lurking in a water hole, Murray observed the charismatic Dimitrov without blinking. Then, at the business end of each set, he pounced decisively.

His ruthlessness owed much to the mental and physical resilience honed through the long hours of his training block in Miami. Towards the end of last year, Murray and his fitness trainer, Jez Green, started working to improve his foot speed and shot power, by doubling his weekly weightlifting sessions from two to four. The satisfying result was that he stacked on an extra three pounds of muscle.

During his sojourns in his penthouse flat overlooking Miami’s South Beach, Murray performs his bar-dips and leg-presses at the Sports Club/LA, an elegantly appointed gym frequented by Miami Heat basketball players, WWF wrestlers and the odd Hollywood actor. He goes mostly unnoticed amid the glitz, yet one suspects he would prefer a different kind of anonymity – that provided by the dusty, egalitarian boxing gym.

“When I first went to see David Haye train, I just found it very interesting,” he says. “Because there’s a big difference between the places where we train and play, and where the boxers do it: they only need a ring and a speed bag and a heavy bag and they can make up the rest. It was just cool seeing them all training alongside people who had just come in from the street. You don’t see that in tennis much.”

The irony of Murray’s boxing fixation is that he is a kind-hearted soul. He has never been in a fight and admits that he suffered such a frightening surge of adrenalin when he sat at ringside for Haye’s bout against Wladimir Klitschko that he had to leave the arena after two rounds.

The most violent behaviour you ever see from him is his habit of repeatedly smacking his own forehand – an extreme version of Homer Simpson’s “D’oh” – after a poor choice of shot. In a recent interview, Murray’s coach, Ivan Lendl, made a rare complaint about his charge’s gentle nature, suggesting that “I think Andy is too nice sometimes”, and complaining that he is too prone to play a clever lob off a short ball when “I wanted it buried, either in the corner or the guy’s nuts”.

When the remark is mentioned, Murray grins wolfishly. “That’s his style. I mean, Ivan would do it often. I’ve done it. I hit [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga at Wimbledon. But it wouldn’t be something I would choose to do. I would rather hit the ball into the open court than try to hit my opponent, but if it’s there and it’s the play that you need to use to win the point, then fine. Hitting passing shots straight up the middle of the court is a legitimate play because guys rarely expect it.”

The relationship between the leading players is far more harmonious these days than in the 1980s, when Lendl was barely on speaking terms with John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors. YouTube offers a classic clip of Lendl driving the ball from short range at McEnroe, who recently complained that “I got hit by Ivan more than by any other player – by all players combined probably. It was an incredible amount of times”.

Whether the new culture of respect is a good thing for tennis or not – and there are plenty of pundits who would like to see a bit more edge in what has become a domesticated sport – the sheer quality of the four leading players has made their showdowns into some of the most sought-after contests in the world.

In fact, you could argue that Messrs Djokovic, Federer, Murray and Nadal are today’s equivalent of Tyson, Lewis, Holyfield and Riddick Bowe. Is there a case to be made that, if heavyweight boxing was the pinnacle of sport 20 years ago, then tennis is producing the greatest individual rivalries of our time?

“I don’t know,” is Murray’s tactful answer. “But the crowds at the big events, especially the latter stages of the majors, have been extremely high. The amount of money that tickets at Wimbledon were going for last year would suggest that those matches were some of the biggest sporting events in the world. Tickets were going for tens of thousands of pounds, which is ridiculous really.”

Murray’s market value is likely only to rise as he returns to Wimbledon this year, having finally laid Fred Perry’s ghost to rest by winning the US Open. Before that, though, he will take his latest tilt at the Australian Open, a tournament where he has reached two finals and a semi in the past three years. Some players are happy to win one major, but Murray would not be stepping up his training regime were he not determined to build on what he achieved at Flushing Meadows in September.

“The US Open and the Olympics made me extremely motivated,” Murray says. “It wasn’t a case of, ‘Oh, everything’s done now’. It’s taken a long time to get there and to win those sorts of events. I know the feeling when you do win them now, and it’s worth all of the work that you put in.

“In the past, there were loads and loads of questions. I wasn’t physically strong enough. I wasn’t mentally strong enough. I didn’t listen to my coaches. I was spoilt. Whatever it was, none of that really bothers me any more. I’m just looking for ways to keep improving.”
