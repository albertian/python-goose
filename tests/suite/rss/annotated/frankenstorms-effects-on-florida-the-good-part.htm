		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Hurricane Sandy....which is being dubbed "Frankenstorm" by the national media...is still on track for a near-historic encounter with the Northeast US early next week.

There's been no significant change in computer model solutions since yesterday...and my forecast for the mid-Atlantic states is unchanged. See my blog from yesterday for what this  storm might do up North.

As it turns out, "Frankenstorm's" effect on SW Florida in actually quite good. The storm's huge circulation will team with a dynamic jet stream pattern to bring a surprisingly cool Autumn airmass down to Florida.

Computer models project that our high temperatures most of next week will stay in the 70s.

Low temperatures on at least one or two mornings will cool deep into the 50s...maybe even some upper 40s deep inland.

If there's any question as to whether the rainy season has ended yet...that will be settled by Monday. The arrival of the very dry and cool continental air will chase the last of summer's high humidity away from Florida....ending our 2012 rainy season once and for all.

Even better....the Autumn airmass will start cooling the Gulf and the Atlantic either side of Florida....and will even penetrate South of Cuba into the Caribbean.

Cooler water surrounding the peninsula...drier air in the tropics makes it harder for new tropical storms to form.

And with history as a guide, this pattern change might also mean the end of Florida's Hurricane season for 2012.</span>
