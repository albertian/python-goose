		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - A semitrailer hauling 32 bulls slammed into a tree on I-75, snarling traffic on the highway and forcing Florida Highway Patrol officials to chase down and shoot 1 of 3 animals that escaped.

A veterinarian sedated another of the animals with a dart. The first was shot for being overly aggressive after Saturday's crash.

The Gainesville Sun (http://tinyurl.com/byu867k) reported Sunday that a crew of cowboys, veterinarians and state troopers set up chutes with portable metal fences to offload the bulls from the semi into trailers that would transport them to South Florida.

Bryan Martin said he and driver Travis Carr were hauling the bulls from Texas to Indiantown.

Carr was hospitalized with serious injuries. His condition was unknown Sunday.

An entrance to the highway was blocked for several hours.
