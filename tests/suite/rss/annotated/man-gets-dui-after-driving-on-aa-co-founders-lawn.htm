                  <p class = "x-nc-sel2">DORSET, Vt. (AP) - Vermont State Police say a man faces a drunken driving charge after driving onto the lawn of a historic home once owned by the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
                  <p class = "x-nc-sel2">Police say 55-year-old Donald Blood III of Marlborough, Mass., was ordered to appear in court in Bennington on Jan. 14.</p>
                  <p class = "x-nc-sel2">Police say Blood thought he was driving into a parking lot, but actually it was the lawn of the Wilson House, built in 1852 in Dorset, the birthplace of AA co-founder Bill Wilson.</p>
                  <p class = "x-nc-sel2">The Wilson House&#39;s website describes it as a "place of sanctuary where people can come to give thanks to God for their new lives."</p>
                  <p class = "x-nc-sel2">It still hosts several AA meetings each week.</p>
