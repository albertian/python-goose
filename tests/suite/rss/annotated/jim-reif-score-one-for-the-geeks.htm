		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">When I was a meteorology student at Penn State many (many) years ago, I quickly learned that there were two types of aspiring meteorologists.

Some wanted to be "theoreticians" -- scientists that study the serious math and physics of the science.

A lot of these folks usually went on to develop the computer models that would simulate the behavior of the atmosphere.

Others wanted to become "synopticians" -- meteorologists who would use the computer models in the real world to skillfully predict the day to day weather.

There was always a rivalry between the two camps. The scientists seemed a little jealous of the forecasters, as forecasters would get all the glory from the scientists' hard work.

The forecasters didn't get along with the scientists because the scientists were, for lack of a better term, the nerds... the geeks on campus.

Well here it is, 40 years later, and it's time to give the geeks their due.

Because the world of computer models has come along way, thanks to the theoreticians. A prime example of this would be Hurricane Sandy.

Back in the 1980s, forecasting the development, track and intensity of a developing hurricane was risky business if you tried to make that forecast for more than three days in the future.

But thanks to bigger and faster computers - most especially more accurate computer models -  both National Weather Service and broadcast meteorologists were able to do some amazing things with Sandy's forecast.

We were able to predict Sandy's birth down in the south-central Caribbean Sea about a week before it was designated a tropical depression.

And there were computer models that nailed the forecast of Sandy's head-on hit of the northeast United States five and six days in advance.

So, score one for who we once considered the 'weather geeks.' The computer modeling that they've done played a key role in saving many lives over the past few days.  

And though they are neither geeks, egg-heads and nerds (most of them anyway) - our hats are off to the fine folks at the National Hurricane Center who made some great forecasts with those computer models.</span>
