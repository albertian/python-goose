QPR midfielder Stephane Mbia wants to see Jose Bosingwa make the right kind of impact for the club. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> Mbia has said he would never refuse to sit on the bench like Bosingwa did two weeks ago against Fulham.

But Mbia is hopeful that Bosingwa can resolve his dispute with manager Harry Redknapp as he believes the Portuguese right-back can aid QPR's bid to avoid relegation from the Premier League.

Bosingwa was absent from QPR's squad for the second successive game on Boxing Day, paying the price for refusing to sit on the bench in the Londoners' derby against Fulham on Dec 15.

Redknapp fined Bosingwa two weeks' wages - Â£130,000 - before launching an angry tirade against the defender and some of his team-mates when news of the fine emerged.

Mbia appreciates Bosingwa's qualities as a footballer but insists he would never have acted in the way that the player who won the Champions League with Chelsea did


"If the manager tells me to sit on the bench I will do it," Mbia said following QPR's 2-1 defeat at West Brom. "It's up to the manager to make the decisions.

"If he wants you to sit on the bench, you sit on the bench. It's a very difficult and complicated situation. Hopefully at the end of the day the club and player can sort it out as Jose is a very good player."

Redknapp clearly hoped that publicly berating some of the expensive imports brought in under Mark Hughes would spark them to life.

To a certain extent the move worked. Despite losing their Boxing Day game - thanks largely to two very questionable decisions from referee Chris Foy - the likes of Mbia and Samba Diakite put on a much-improved display.

Although QPR remain six points from safety, Redknapp has brought in six of the club's 10 points since he replaced Mark Hughes last month and Mbia remains convinced the former Tottenham manager will lead the team out of the relegation zone.

"I believe in him. I believe he is the man to get us out of trouble," Mbia said. "It's up to the players to give 100 per cent, but the manager will give a lot to us.

"He has helped me a lot already. He has try to make me a more intelligent player. He wants me to be more careful on the pitch so I don't pick up needless yellow and red cards.

"I definitely think we can stay up. The gaffer gives us so much confidence, he uses so many different words, I know we can do it."
