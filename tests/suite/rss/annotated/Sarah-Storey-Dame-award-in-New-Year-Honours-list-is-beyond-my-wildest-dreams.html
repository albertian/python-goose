Just when I thought 2012 could not get any better comes the extraordinary privilege of being made a Dame in the New Year’s Honours list, which is quite incredible. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> I am really not quite sure what to expect so now I look forward to talking, as soon as possible, to that very wise lady, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who has been a great friend and mentor over the years and also received a damehood fairly young in life. What happens now, Tanni?

I could never have imagined all of this 12 months ago when my husband Barney and I saw the new year in and wondered exactly what London 2012 had in store for us. Four Paralympic gold medals – and one for Barney – was beyond my wildest hopes but then on top of that to fall pregnant in the autumn and then to be nominated on the shortlist for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award seemed almost too much.

And now this. I am of course expecting a huge amount of mickey-taking and curtsies from the family for a few weeks. But seriously, they are all delighted and in my mind the honour is a reflection of all the love and hard work everybody – family and friends – have put into my career over the past 20 or so years.

The family are already planning shopping expeditions to buy outfits for the investiture. All we know at the moment is that it could be any time between now and June and if its towards the end of that period I will be very big indeed. Not that it matters in the slightest – the baby is going to be very much on show whenever it happens because the bump is already starting to show.

My envelope from the Palace arrived when I was in training camp in Lanzarote a month ago and from that moment everything is strictly under embargo. It has actually been very difficult to keep the secret because there has been plenty of speculation and people have been talking to me for a couple of weeks as if it had already happened, which I was quite uncomfortable with. 


I am old fashioned and very traditional about these matters. This is the time of year for family – possibly for the first time altogether after a long season – and I wanted to share the moment with them first.

I am very aware that this honour also reflects on the Paralympic movement in Great Britain and offers further proof as to the high esteem in which Paralympians are now held. It demonstrates also how far the Paralympic movement has come since I those heady days when I first became involved as a 14-year-old swimmer in Barcelona in 1992 and I am so proud of the progress we have made.

One of the great legacies of 2012 is that people have started to understand the breadth of Paralympic sport, we have moved away from the cliché that it was always about severely disabled athletes in wheelchairs. There is now a much wider understanding of the range of ’disabilities’ that in everyday life are perhaps not really a disability at all but only become apparent in the sporting arena.

Perhaps best of all the London Paralympics showcased what great sport the movement now serves up. Sport fans and spectators started having opinions and discussions purely on our performances and results – on how we fared, what times we produced, could we have done better – rather than anything else. That is music to the ears of a Paralympian.

In every respect London 2012 was without doubt the biggest step forward the Paralympics has seen.
