		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Goodbye Mr. Wilson - and thank you: By Jim Reif</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The Director of Lee County Public Safety, up until this Friday, was John Wilson. A man of many hats, he was involved in Lee County's MEDSTAR controversy, which brought about his abrupt retirement.

I'll be the first to admit that I know little about what went on with MEDSTAR, let alone where to point fingers.

But I do know the John Wilson that wore the hat of County Emergency Manager, and in that position, there was no finer man.

John has been taking care of Lee County's Division of Emergency Management since the early 1980s, and he hit the ground running.

If there was an idea that made sense about getting folks ready for a hurricane, he was chasing it down and looking for a way to impliment it.

Some of his ideas were so good that they were copied up and down Florida's coast by his fellow emergency managers.

I got to know John personally at the Hurricane Awareness Seminars that we attended as speakers.

Other places in Florida (excepting Charlotte County), Emergency Managers would send their deputies or some other staff to represent their departments at these seminars.

Not John. He'd work an 8 hour day - then come out and talk with the folks for another two hours in the evenings.

Sometimes the turnout was in the hundreds; For others, just a handful would show up. But so many times, he was there.  

Lessons learned - I'll count myself as a student of John Wilson and how he made Lee County safer from storms.

Never a media star, John was as responsible as anyone else for saving lives in our encounter with both Charley and Wilma.

I'd wish him a great retirement, but I think John has some more hurricane safety lessons to teach before he finishes a great career.</span>
