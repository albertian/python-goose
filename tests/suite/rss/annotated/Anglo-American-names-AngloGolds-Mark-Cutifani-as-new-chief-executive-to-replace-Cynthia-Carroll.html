FTSE 100 mining giant Anglo American has named Mark Cutifani from rival AngloGold Ashanti as its new chief executive. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> He will replace Cynthia Carroll at the helm of the company on April 3, after she announced her intention to step down last October, bowing to shareholder pressure.

The miner confirmed that Mr Cutifani will receive a basic salary of £1.2m and "variable incentive arrangements".

Australian-born Mr Cutifani joined AngloGold in 2007 as chief executive, having previously been chief operating officer of Inco of Canada, which is now part of Vale.

A mining engineer by training, he is credited with reducing the number of deaths at AngloGold as part of a crackdown on dangerous practices.

Anglo American’s chairman, Sir John Parker, said: "Mark Cutifani is an experienced listed company chief executive with a focus on creating value. 


"He is a seasoned miner, with broad experience of mining operations and projects across a wide range of commodities and geographies, including South Africa and the Americas.

"Mark is a highly respected leader in the global mining industry, with values strongly aligned to those of Anglo American."

Ms Carroll will step down from the company's board at the AGM in April and will leave Anglo American at the end of that month.

The Daily Telegraph first revealed in August last year that investors were unhappy with Ms Carroll, noting that several of the miner’s largest institutional investors had asked the chairman, Sir John Parker, to find a replacement.

Concerns were said to include the miner’s profitability, its continued dependence on South Africa, and cost overruns on major projects. The results of a review into Amplats, Anglo American’s South African platinum mining division, are understood to be planned for release this month.

The review was launched in February 2012 as the business struggled with the pressures of reduced demand for platinum due to slowing car production, escalating running costs and labour unrest in South Africa.

The company is likely to mothball or even sell parts of its operations in the country.

Any plans to close mines risk provoking further unrest in South Africa, which was hit by violent strikes in 2012.
