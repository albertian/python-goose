Pierre Hantai

Why bother with the strange, remote language of classical music?

Because it offers a unique blend of musical sophistication and emotional light and shade is the usual reply. Which is true, but there are classical pieces which get their power the same way as many pop songs, ie obsessing away at one thing with blinding clarity. And yet, because of the huge sophistication of the language, the flavour is immensely subtle as well as strong. This harpsichord sonata by the Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti is one such piece.

Scarlatti was born in the same miraculous year of 1685 as Bach and Handel, though he couldn’t be more different. They were Protestant North Germans by birth, both sophisticated masters of many different forms, able to mingle German, French and Italian influences into their music. Whereas Scarlatti is Mediterranean through and through. His music is full of blazing sun and violent black shadows. He’s famous for composing harpsichord sonatas, hundreds of them, nearly all in the same simple two-part form where each half is repeated (if you can’t stand the sound of the harpsichord, don’t worry – plenty of pianists have recorded Scarlatti’s sonatas). 
 Scarlatti was a virtuoso harpsichordist at a time when being a virtuoso really mattered. There’s a nice story about Scarlatti seeing a rival amaze an audience at the harpsichord in Venice. It was carnival time, so the player was wearing a mask. “Either that’s the devil playing,” said Scarlatti, “or the famous Saxon” (meaning Handel). It was Handel, but Scarlatti came within an ace of beating Handel in a harpsichord competition, so he must have been devilishly good himself.

His sonatas are certainly devilish to play. They’re full of hammered chords and hugely difficult hand-crossings, where one hand holds a busy pattern in the middle of the keyboard while the other leaps from top to bottom and back again (Bach was impressed by this, and it rubbed off on his own music in pieces like the Goldberg Variations).

It was a strange career move on Scarlatti’s part to focus so obsessively on the private medium of sonatas rather than moneymaking genres like opera. It happened because fate plucked him out of his native Italy, and put him down in a completely different culture. In 1719 he took on the job of musical director at the Royal Chapel in Lisbon. One of his royal pupils was the Princess Maria Barbara, and when she married the Spanish Prince Ferdinando, Scarlatti moved with her to the Spanish court.

There he stayed until his death in 1757, writing among many other things hundreds of sonatas to amuse his royal pupil – who must have been a mean keyboard player herself. They have a unique sharp, spicy flavour, utterly different from the norm of late Baroque keyboard music represented by composers like Telemann or Handel (Bach was unusual in a different way). Their works have a Frenchified stateliness, with neat dance forms following one another in set patterns. Whereas Scarlatti’s sonatas are like snapshots of a particular scene or genre. There are brusque dances, sweet little pastorales, marches, and weird angular laments.

Running through all of them are unmistakable signs of the delighted shock Scarlatti must have felt on arriving in the foreign musical culture of Iberia, and hearing its folk music. You can hear the strumming of guitars in his sonatas, with their odd “wrong note” open strings pushing against the academically correct notes sounded at the same time. It sounds startlingly modern, and it makes Scarlatti seem our contemporary in a way Bach and Handel never do.

But Scarlatti didn’t go native. We shouldn’t think of him as an 18th-century Gauguin, wearing the clothes of the Spanish muleteers whose songs he noted down. He was a famously cultured and urbane character, and what gives his music its special flavour is the way 18th-century courtliness and wild, strumming folky energy sit side-by-side.

LISTENING POINTS

00.00 The speed and constant Ta-tata-ta-ta rhythm suggests a march, but the feeling is too hectic and driven and fierce to be martial.

00.10 a running bass makes the music scamper off in a new direction, but then it seems to get obsessed with one harmonic area and hammers away at until the first part of the sonata ends, before repeating itself. This contrast between breakneck motion and obsessive emphasis on one or two chords is very typical of Scarlatti.

1.32 The sonata moves on to its second half. This is even odder than the first half, with some very scrunchy chords, and a surprise minor harmony at 1.44 where we expect major (alongside some perfectly normal Baroque progressions, which is what makes these oddities so very odd).

1.52 The music seems to get stuck again, just as it did in the first half, until finally it tears itself free and comes to a close at 2.16. Then we hear the whole of the second half again. There’s a strange quality in those moments of fixity, almost like desperation. It might remind us of a much later form of Latin passion – the tango, where intensity can also seem close to despair.

FURTHER LISTENING

1. If you can’t stand that harpsichord clatter, try the piano version of the same sonata, given a less furious, more delicate quality by Andras Schiff.

________________________________________________

2. You could spend a whole year exploring Scarlatti’s 500-odd sonatas. The Sonata in C minor K56 is astounding for its physicality. Just listen to the way Hantai’s right hand jumps over the left at 00.29, hitting the right note every time.

________________________________________________

3. Scarlatti wasn’t always fierce, as the lovely Pastorale K380 shows. It’s beautifully played here by Mikhail Pletnev.

________________________________________________

4. Scarlatti could also strike a plaintively sad, slow note. In his B minor sonata K87, the pathos comes from the way the music finds its way to a painfully intense harmonic region and then obsesses at it. So under the surface it’s not so different from his fast pieces.
