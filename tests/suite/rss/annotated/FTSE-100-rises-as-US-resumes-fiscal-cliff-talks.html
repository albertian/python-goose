The FTSE 100 opened down before edging higher in early trading as US lawmakers prepared to resume negotiations to avoid the fiscal cliff and the yen hit a 21-month low on the prospect of drastic monetary easing. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> The index of leading UK shares was up 37 points - or 0.6pc - at 5991.78 at 12.30pm after slipping 0.15pc at the open. Other major markets in Europe rose, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC up 0.3pc and 0.5pc respectively.

In a sign that there may be a way to break the deadlock in the US Congress, Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner urged the Democrat-controlled Senate to act and offered to at least consider any bill the upper chamber produced.

President Barack Obama will try to revive budget crisis talks which stalled last week when he returns to Washington today after cutting short his Christmas holiday in Hawaii.

"There is still hope for a last-minute deal, otherwise we're in for a correction in January. People have already priced in an agreement. Without it, the market can't stay at these levels," a Paris-based trader said.

Economists warn that the "fiscal cliff" of higher taxes and spending cuts worth $600bn could push the world's largest economy into recession, dragging other countries with it. 


Such concerns underpinned the dollar as the fiscal impasse continues to sap investor appetite for risky assets, raising the dollar's safe-haven appeal.

Against the yen, the dollar at 85.87 yen reached its highest since September 2010, with investors accelerating their yen sales after new Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government would pursue a bold monetary policy, a flexible fiscal policy and a growth strategy to encourage private investment.

The euro, which is being supported by a better outlook towards the euro zone, climbed 0.4 per cent to $1.3266.

Asian shares rose, with Tokyo scaling a 21-month high due to the weaker yen but it was held back by concerns about a US "fiscal cliff" deal.

Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.91pc, or 92.62 points, to 10,322.98, the highest level since March 11 last year when a massive quake struck Japan, sparking a tsunami and the worst atomic crisis in a generation.

Seoul closed 0.26pc higher at 1,987.35 and Sydney gained 0.28pc to 4,648.0. Hong Kong was up 0.36 per cent in afternoon trade while Shanghai eased 0.6pc.

US stocks fell overnight on continued uncertainty about whether a deal to avert the fiscal cliff – a series of steep tax hikes and spending cuts worth some $600 billion due to take effect in January – could be reached by the end of the month.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 0.19pc at 13,114.59. The broader S&P 500 lost 0.5pc and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite shed 0.74pc.

The Treasury Department said on Wednesday that the government would hit its legal borrowing limit by Monday, setting in motion emergency measures to keep the government operating for several more weeks.

The Treasury's manoeuvring is designed to put off until February or March the prospect of a full-blown debt crisis, indicating that the US budget wrangling could continue well into 2013.
