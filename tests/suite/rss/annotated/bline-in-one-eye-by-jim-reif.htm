		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Where would we be without our weather satellites? Awfully bad in our accuracy ratings, that's for sure. They are so important that there are 3 of them watching weather patterns over North America.

GOES-13 watches the Eastern US and the tropical Atlantic. GOES 15 monitors the Western US, Alaska and Hawaii. GOES 14 is a spare, just in case one of the other two has a problem.

As it happens, GOES 13...the satellite with the best view of Florida, is on the fritz right now.

The data channel sending the pictures back to earth became very noisy with interference and had to be turned off. Technicians have been working on the problem but there's a chance that the 6 year old satellite cannot be repaired.

So GOES 14 has picked up the slack and is behaving quite normally. One minor issue, this backup satellite sits in geostationary orbit about 1500 miles farther West than GOES 13.

At the moment, that means its view of the distant East Atlantic is not very clear. That should not be a major problem...since the end of the Cape Verde season (where storms can form off of Africa) is just a week away.</span>
