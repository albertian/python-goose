The old folks' retreat at the heart of Ronald Harwood's film could be a template for future care homes </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> The film of Quartet is adorable: it has heavenly music, mostly by Verdi, fabulous stars – you can’t go wrong with Maggie Smith and Billy Connolly – its director is Dustin Hoffman, and the writer is Ronald Harwood, a terrific playwright who does old age especially well.

However, the old folk’s home portrayed in the movie is nothing like any care home I have visited, and I’ve known a few: I have even resided in one, when convalescing from a hip operation. In contrast to my experience, Beecham House is sumptuous, set in wonderful grounds and peopled by charming and witty oldies. Not an incontinence pad in sight, nor any dementia-afflicted 90-year-olds calling for their mothers.

But there is a great idea at the heart of Quartet – it might be a template for care homes in future. Beecham House is supposedly for retired musicians. It would be wonderful if retirement homes were categorised according to profession or life interest. One of the depressing aspects of most care homes is that people are walled up with a bunch of strangers with whom they usually have very little in common.

It might be quite pleasant to be in a retirement home where the other inmates shared your vocation, trade or life experience. There are, I know, care homes for those in the theatrical profession (although the one I know of costs in the region of £50,000 a year). The corridors apparently ring with sweet trillings from old dolls telling one another, “Darling, I loved your Juliet in 1948.”

There are retirement homes for old journalists – I ought to explore that option: hopefully the corridors ring with reminiscences from El Vino, circa 1967, and yarns about deadlines made or missed. But whatever our interest, vocation or life experience, it must be more cheering and comforting to have people around us who can share recollections of the past. The characters in the movie may be a somewhat glamorous projection of old age, but the thread that runs through the narrative is that these old people have a fabulous interest in common – music. And that makes life worth living. 


Devout ladies of the night

Soho has always been a place for bohemians (as Sophie Parkin’s new book about the often ghastly Colony Club discloses), and the “gay Masses” – now abolished, or transferred by the Catholic Archbishop Vincent Nichols – were somewhat in the unorthodox tradition of that London neighbourhood.

According to the legendary patron of the French House in Soho, the late Gaston Berlemont, prostitutes would often frequent Masses there. Indeed, he waxed quite lyrical about the holiness of the French girls who came to London in the Forties and Fifties. “They had beautiful manners,” he told me nostalgically. “They would never ply for trade in the pub. Such finesse, such discretion. And they never missed Mass on a Sunday at St Patrick’s.”

But wasn’t the churchgoing somewhat in conflict with, well, the prostitution? “Oh no,” said Gaston. “Their faith had nothing to do with their profession. The Almighty would understand that.” Why shouldn’t a sex-worker – as we nowadays more prosaically say – be religious? And why shouldn’t everyone and anyone have a service that provides for their spiritual needs?

Beware the de-clutterer

There’s a new profession gaining ground, especially in January: the “de-clutterer”. This is someone you engage to come and de-clutter your home. But what treasures are thrown out in the name of tidying? When an aged aunt of mine died, the local authority “de-cluttered” her flat, and threw out sacks of family letters going back to the 1900s. One person’s clutter is another person’s valuable historic archive: be mindful of what you chuck out.
