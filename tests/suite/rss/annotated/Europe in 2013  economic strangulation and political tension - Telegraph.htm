Compared to 2012, next year for the eurozone will be the difference between being bitten by a poisonous viper and being strangled in the coils of a python, writes Bruno Waterfield.</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The eurozone last year survived the prospect of sudden death via a Greek exit from the single currency only to face slower strangulation by recession in 2013.
Deep malaise in the eurozone and woes at home, will not help British supporters of the European Union make their case as the 40th anniversary of the country's membership arrives in 2013 coinciding with debate over its future.
A speech by David Cameron, the Prime Minister, will set out his EU strategy later in January on an issue that deeply divides his party and coalition government.
The Europe question has always been divisive.
News archives for 22 January 1973 will commemorate both Sir Edward Heath's signing of the European treaty and the moment following it when a female protester threw ink over him.
Chances of a break-up for the eurozone receded in 2012 but the fundamental flaws and imbalances in its structure remain, combined with recession and the prospect of a protracted economic slump in Southern Europe.
The crushing economic squeeze will be accompanied by the constant danger that a full-blown crisis will flare up as uncomfortable political and economic realities are repeatedly pushed home throughout the year.
The euro's three biggest economies outside Germany face funding costs of £640 billion (€780bn) in a year when recession is forecast.
France, Italy and Spain, with borrowing costs of €243 billion, €332bn and €207bn respectively will hope that promises of liquidity and bond buying from the European Central Bank will be convincing.
The more convincing the bailouts and bond purchase measures are, the more controversial they will be in countries such as Germany, Finland, Austria and Holland.
Spain, riven by social conflict and the risk of break-up posed by nationalist movements in Catalonia or the Basque country, will be the first to ask for help in early 2013.
Help for Spain, or any other country, will trigger fierce debate (and possible delays) in Northern European creditor countries such as Germany, where elections take place in September.
Aid must first be voted through in German, Finnish, Austrian and Dutch parliaments as political tensions over the huge cash transfers from North to South grow.
Last year, Angela Merkel lost her "Chancellor's majority" on eurozone bailout votes in the Bundestag meaning that she is vulnerable, needing the support of opposition Social Democrats and Greens during an election year.
If unemployment grows in Germany amid a predicted slowdown in euro's largest economy then Chancellor Merkel could face the toxic decision of putting billions of euros into Spain at a time when the German welfare state is under strain.
Italian elections in February could tilt the eurozone back into full-blown crisis amid political uncertainty over the return of Silvio Berlusconi, who in 2011 took Italy to the brink.
As 2012 ended, Mario Monti, the unelected technocrat who restored market confidence in Italy, was still being coy about how, or if, he could return to power.
Embroiled in scandal, Mr Berlusconi has horrified EU leaders with his return to politics and populist tilting at Germanic eurozone austerity policies.
But a divided centre-left, and a vacillating Mr Monti, could put him on track to win, a moment that would trigger market turbulence and push the eurozone back to the brink.
With a general economic slowdown across the Europe and increasing social conflict over austerity programmes the norm, political tensions will rise.
Tensions between Mrs Merkel and Francois Hollande will hobble the eurozone's ability to act as the French Socialist President struggles to cut borrowing and implement domestic unpopular economic reforms with early evidence that France's entrepreneurs are fleeing his high taxes.
President Hollande is likely to be angered by German electioneering that will draw negative comparisons between Germany and France's failure to bite the bullet on economic restructuring.
Meanwhile, the Greek economy is expected to contract by at least a further four per cent in a country where growing anger over austerity imposed by the EU and IMF is a constant threat to stability.
As 2013 unfolds, the failure of EU and ECB forecasts for economic growth in Greece (which have so far been consistently wrong) could unravel the eurozone's survival strategy.
In a bleak analysis of the year ahead, Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at the Open Europe think tank, concluded that economic stagnation and political uncertainty, with low growth and high unemployment would continue to plague many countries.
"Next year is not only likely to see domestic politics across the EU clash with the economic realities of the eurozone crisis and EU integration, but also countries increasingly being pitted against one another," he said.
After German elections in the autumn, a victorious Chancellor Merkel, whether she is in or out of coalition, is expected to come out fighting for "political union". putting EU treaty change back on the agenda.
Mr Cameron's much-trailed Europe speech, expected in mid-January, will seek to tread a delicate line, promising renegotiation to avoid a Brexit, or British exit from the EU.
The Conservative Prime Minister faces difficult decisions on pulling out of the EU policing measures and fraught negotiations over the size of the Brussels budget next year.
Tense discussions within the Tories, with the anti-EU Ukip on the rise and with the Liberal Democrats in the coalition will mean that the question of an EU referendum will continue to loom large next year.
As 2013 dawns, enthusiastic celebrations of Britain's 40 years of membership are unlikely to be in much evidence outside EU offices in London or the tiny numbers of British "Europhiles".
Next year also brings the 20th anniversary of the entering into force of the Maastricht Treaty that created the euro and the legal concept of EU citizenship.
To mark it, the EU will be celebrating with "European Year of the citizens". But popular rejoicing will be thin on the ground as political tensions grow and unemployment approaches the 30 million mark across Europe.</span>
