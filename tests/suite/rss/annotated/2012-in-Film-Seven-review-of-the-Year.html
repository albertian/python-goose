Non-fiction films shone brightest at the cinema in 2012: the best year for documentary in living memory, says Mike McCahill.</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">It has felt like a spotty year, during which we were left watching the further decline of a once-mighty manufacturing empire. As Disney’s wretchedly cluttered space epic John Carter crashed and burned, the Hollywood studios looked to have forgotten how to make the sure things that were once its bread-and-butter.

Worse, they seemed to have forgotten how to market them: Ridley Scott’s quiet, eerie, design-rich Prometheus turned out to be more art installation than the commercial horror it was so aggressively sold as. One sensed the mainstream struggling to manage our expectations, let alone surpass them.

The default position for 2012’s bigger releases was either nostalgia (from Spielberg’s muted War Horse to Tim Burton’s larky Dark Shadows) or novelty (found footage, 3D, high-definition 48 frames per second). When the 70mm format was revived, for Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master, it helped that the film was big and mysterious enough not to need the gimmickry.

There were teen-oriented hits, as ever: Avengers Assemble, Ted, The Hunger Games. Yet some old reliables (Christopher Nolan’s Batman reboots, the Twilight saga) came to an end, and the muted response to Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit only left one wondering: where now?</span>
