Sunderland are hoping to sign Swansea striker Danny Graham this week as Martin O’Neill looks to add another attacking dimension to his side. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> Graham has scored three goals in his last three appearances for Swansea, including their equaliser in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal in the FA Cup last weekend, but has been replaced as the club’s main striker by Spanish import Michu.

The 27 year-old has previously aired his frustration at being asked to spend so much time on the bench after scoring 14 goals in his first season in the top flight.

That has been noted by O’Neill, who hopes to persuade Swansea manager Michael Laudrup to part with the striker with an official bid expected in the next 24 hours.

Sunderland are willing to offer around £4 million for Graham and hope to be able to bring him back to his native North East to discuss personal terms this week.

Although Steven Fletcher has been a success on Wearside following his £12  million summer move from Wolverhampton Wanderers, O’Neill wants more competition for places in attack. 


Fletcher has mainly played as a lone striker with Stephane Sessegnon given a free role behind him, but O’Neill feels Graham could be an ideal strike partner for the Scotland international.

Sunderland signed Louis Saha on a free transfer in the summer, but he has failed to score in 11 appearances, while teenager Connor Wickham remains a work in progress on the training ground according to O’Neill.

Laudrup hinted on Sunday that Graham’s future would be his to decide. “He is playing well and is important for us because he is scoring goals, but let’s see what he says,” said Laudrup. “I am going to speak to all players who are not playing regularly.”

Sunderland may face competition from neighbours Newcastle for Graham as their manager, Alan Pardew, is also an admirer.

Graham has always maintained he would like return to his native North East having begun his career with Chester-le-Street, before joining Middlesbrough’s academy.

Despite failing to establish himself in Middlesbrough’s first team, Graham has worked his way back up to the top level following successful spells at Carlisle United and Watford.

Sunderland, meanwhile, are also close to announcing the £3 million signing of France Under-21 international midfielder Alfred N’Diaye from Turkish club Bursaspor.
