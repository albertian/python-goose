Just weeks before he fell 150 feet to his death from above a waterfall near Sydney, Josh Furber, a 20-year-old English tourist, declared "Australia well and truly has my heart and soul". </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> A construction student at Leeds Metropolitan University, Furber had moved several months ago to live near Sydney's iconic Bondi beach. He described his new group of friends as his "Australia family".

In recent tweets, Furber, who is from the town of Runcorn in Cheshire, declared "the world is a beautiful place" and said he had never been so excited for a new year's eve. 


Tragically, on Sunday afternoon, he fell to his death while climbing on rocks with his friends above a waterfall at Wentworth Falls, a popular spot for daytrips from Sydney. His parents are understood to be travelling to Australia.

Police said the fall occurred at 2.15pm while Furber "was off the walking track". A witness said he had been "mucking around on the rocks" with his friends. 


The tragedy has led to an outpouring of grief from family and friends, including an online tribute page and plans for a memorial in Britain.

Furber's sister said on Facebook: "My bestest friend and my brother, things won't ever be the same. We are heartbroken and we won't ever get over this.

Words can't describe how much I miss and love you Josh!" A friend wrote: "Too many too young, Rest in peace Josh Furber. Good lad with a good soul. I hope you find the peace we spent [our] whole lives lookin for." On the tribute page, a friend wrote: "You knew how to live your life to the fullest! You achieved a lot for the short life you lived, travelled the USA and got to see the amazing Australia. You chased your dreams and you lived the dream."

Police said the trail where the fall occurred was "unrailed and unfenced" and are preparing a report for the coroner.

"It's a waterfall area, so it's slippery and muddy, it's very unstable," said Ian Colless, from the local police rescue squad.

In recent tweets, Furber had described his excitement at his new life and his circle of international friends. He also wrote on December 23: "Being away from all my family at Christmas is so hard."
