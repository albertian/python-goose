Honours for service to London 2012 are not restricted to athletes, with a remarkable 39 officials, executives and civil servants from the various agencies involved in delivering the Olympics receiving awards. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> They range from Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 organising committee (Locog), who becomes a Companion of Honour, to a recruitment consultant at the Department of Work and Pensions, honoured for “services to inclusivity and diversity at London 2012”.

While the suits recognised for their service outnumber Paralympic athletes honoured on the main sports list, many of the leading figures in delivering the games are recognised.

Coe’s deputy Sir Keith Mills, already honoured for his role in the London 2012 bid, receives the Knights Grand Cross, and Paul Deighton, Locog chief executive, receives a knighthood.

Also knighted is Peter Hendy, the commissioner of Transport for London, who is recognised for his efforts in ensuring that the transport network surpassed all expectations during the summer.

Neale Coleman, Boris Johnson’s key Olympic adviser and director of 2012 for the Greater London Authority, is appointed a CBE for his work in delivering the games, which began during the bid under Ken Livingstone. Johnson said that he was “delighted” for Coleman and the honour for Hendy was “richly deserved”. 


Several other key members of the Locog team are recognised, including a CBE for Debbie Jevans, the director of sport who is now chief executive of Rugby World Cup 2015.

There are OBEs for James Bulley, the director of venues and infrastructure, Jackie Brock-Doyle, the director of communications, and Therese Miller, Locog’s general counsel who was Deighton’s key aide.

Ruth Mackenzie, the director of the Cultural Olympiad, is appointed a CBE, while the producer of the torch relay which presaged the games, Deborah Hales, is made an MBE.

More controversially there is an OBE for David Peacop, the head of logistics at CLM, the private company paid £650 million after being retained as “delivery partner” on the construction project.

There are also a raft of awards for civil servants in the Government Olympic Executive, the agency that monitored the Olympic project from Whitehall. Jeremy Beeton, director general of the GOE, receives the Order of the Bath and finance director David Goldstone is appointed a CBE.

There are also honours for civil servants at departments involved in delivering the Games, including a CBE for the director of the UK Border Agency Olympic programme, and the official responsible for accreditation at the office for security and counter terrorism at the Home Office.
