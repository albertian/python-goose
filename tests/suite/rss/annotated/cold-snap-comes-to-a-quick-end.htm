Tonight and again tomorrow afternoon we will see a few showers across Southwest Florida. The favored areas for seeing rain tonight will be along and north of the Caloosahatchee River - especially in Charlotte County.

Temperatures tonight will be very mild compared to last night and we will only drop into the 60s this evening.

A breeze from the southwest will help keep the temperatures from dropping off tonight and will also help warm us back to 77 – 80 degrees tomorrow afternoon.

A cold front is expected to cross the area in the late afternoon tomorrow. In advance of the front we will see variable clouds with showers and/or a thunderstorm arrive in the late afternoon.

It will also be windy tomorrow with southwest winds at 15 – 20 and gusty throughout the day.

The extended outlook shows clearing late Saturday evening and a very nice, but cooler day on Sunday.

Highs to end the weekend will only be around 70 and our overnight low on Monday morning goes back into the 50s.

New Years Eve and New Years Day both look fine with lots of sunshine and pleasant temperatures. </span>
