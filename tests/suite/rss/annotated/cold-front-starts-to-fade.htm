		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">PM Update -

It was a wet start to our first full week of 2013, but we're now trading the rain in for sunshine and much warmer temperatures.

How warm? We're talking mid 80s!

So let me show you how this will all transpire... We're seeing the skies clear tonight as the frontal boundary that brought us the gloomy weather begins to weaken. You can't rule out some very low clouds through the wee hours of Tuesday, but overall it'll be a clear night. Come sunrise we will definitely see areas of fog as temperatures drop to the lower 60s.

From there forward the sunshine pops out and it's here to stay.

Why? Simple, a big mountain of high pressure is moving over the East Coast. That's going to keep our weather sunny, dry, and very warm from Tuesday through the beginning of next week.

Morning lows will continue to be around 60 degrees, and daytime highs will soar to the mid 80s. Tuesday we will see a high of 83, Wednesday a high of 84, and then Thursday we get all the way up to 85 degrees. I wouldn't be surprised if some areas saw temperatures a little above 85 in the days to come.

If you want cold temperaturesâ€¦ You'll have to go north. There isn't a cool down expected for us until mid January.

Enjoy living in paradise!</span>
