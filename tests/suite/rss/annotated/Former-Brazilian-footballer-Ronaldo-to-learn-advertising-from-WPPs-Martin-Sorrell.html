Former Brazilian footballer Ronaldo is moving to the UK to study advertising under WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> The 36-year-old, who played for Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV during an 18-year career, could stay in London for more than two years as he looks to benefit from Sir Martin’s knowledge.

“Eighteen years have passed and I’ve hardly studied at all; I feel a great need to become a student again,” Ronaldo told Brazil’s Meio & Mensagem newspaper.

“I’ve learnt a lot in life, travelling, living abroad, just in the school of life. But I also have to immerse myself in something.

“Learning from Martin Sorrell will be perfect. I won’t leave him alone, I’ll be asking him questions the whole day, just like a striker. He’s going to have to tell me everything.”

Sir Martin confirmed that Ronaldo – who currently runs ad agency 9ine, a joint venture with WPP – would be joining him in the UK. “Ronaldo had already had great success with clients Claro [and] Duracell. He’ll be coming to the UK [to] work with us closely there,” he told the Financial Times. </span>
