		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">What's so special about September 10?</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Two noteworthy events are worth mentioning when we reach September 10th on the calendar.

First, today is the absolute peak of the 6 month hurricane season. Statistically speaking, we see more hurricanes and tropical storms in the Atlantic at this point on the calendar than any other time of the year.

The peak is also considered the statistical half-way point in an average hurricane season. Fortunately, each hurricane season is not statistically aligned.

I'd hate to think that we have another 13 named storms to go by the end of the year. If we did, we'd be looking for storm names in the Greek alphabet...like we did in 2005.

September 10th also has a special meaning for SW Floridians. It was this morning back in 1960...some 52 years ago....that a Category 3 hurricane by the name of Donna came directly up the Collier coastline to make landfall on the southern end of Fort Myers Beach.

Donna's damage on the SW peninsula was measured in the tens of millions of dollars, which doesn't sound like much. But back then, there were only 10,000 people on all of Collier county...and barely 50,000 people in Lee.

Experts say that a similar storm hitting SW Florida today could cause more than $20 billion of damage.

Fortunately, no such storm is out in the Atlantic today. We are still tracking Tropical Storm Leslie and Hurricane Michael in the North Atlantic.

A developing storm in the distant East Atlantic may take the name Nadine in the next day or two. But none of these are a threat to SW Florida.</span>
