		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Firms looking to renovate Hammond Stadium</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">FORT MYERS -The Fort Myers Miracle's contract agreement to play in Hammond Stadium expired at the beginning of the year. And upgrades to the ballpark could impact games in 2014.

The county will likely approve a one year lease agreement with the Fort Myers Miracle instead of a five year because it's looking ahead to a $45-million renovation of the ballpark.

Monday, the Lee County Evaluation Committee heard pitches from three firms looking to renovate Hammond Stadium.

Whatever firm the county decides on, the tentative construction will start right after this year's Twins spring training season.

The Miracle won't be affected this year; it's the 2014 season that could be impacted, depending on the construction schedule.

That's why the county and the Miracle are taking the lease agreement year by year instead of resigning another five year agreement.

"Our number one goal is to play here, this is where our fans are familiar with us playing and this is our home so of course the county understands that and they're doing everything they can to help us achieve that goal for 2014," said Steve Gliner, President of the Fort Myers Miracle.

When we asked the Lee County Parks and Recreation director if the county was looking at other venues for the Miracle to play at if construction affected their schedule, he just said the county maintains four facilities - including the City of Palms, Jet Blue and Terry Park.

But that would be something he would negotiate later down the line when the construction schedule becomes more concrete.

The Evaluation Committee is now ranking the three firms and will hand over the recommendations to the Lee County Board of Commissioners.

The commission will then vote on those at a future commission meeting.</span>
