		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">An endangered whale was found dead along a Florida beach early Wednesday.

The North Atlantic Right Whale was discovered north of Beverly Beach, near Varn Park.

Experts arrived at the scene to perform a necropsy on the whale, which had been dead for a while off shore.

They had to bring in an excavator to get the 30-foot whale out of the surf and into a secure area.

The North Atlantic Right is one of the most endangered whale species in the world, with only about 400 of them left, according to experts.

"We're going to look for clues as to what contributed to its demise," said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologist Barbara Zoodsma.

Zoodsma said they'll look for outward marks, such as bruising and lesions, that could lead to death. Then they'll also look inside the whale.</span>
