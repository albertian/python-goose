Nicaragua's tallest volcano has belched an ash cloud hundreds of feet into the sky in the latest bout of sporadic activity, prompting the evacuation of nearby residents. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The 5,725-foot San Cristobal volcano, which sits around 85 miles north of the capital Managua in the country's northwest, has been active in recent years, and went through a similar episode in September.

The latest activity began late on Tuesday.

Government spokesman Rosario Murillo called on residents who live within a 1.9-mile radius of the volcano to leave the area. Around 300 families live near the volcano.

"We have some families who have self-evacuated. ... We ask (the people) to go to a safe place, it's just for a few days during this emergency," she said, adding it was a precautionary measure.

A billowing grayish cloud could be seen drifting sideways from the volcano's peak.
The volcano also stirred in mid-2008, when it expelled gas and rumbled with a series of small eruptions.
