An anti-gun message on a T-shirt resulted in a man being banned from the Stones River Mall in Murfreesboro,Tennessee and arrested on Saturday.

Some felt the wording on it was "extremely distasteful."

Bryce Myszka, 42, of Murfreesboro said it was a political statement meant to stir debate.

"I knew it would be a polarizing T-shirt," said Myszka. "It did raise eyebrows, and some people were angry."

Myszka had the shirt designed at a mall Kiosk on Saturday, a day after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.

He put the T-shirt on only to find some people staring and making comments as he walked around the mall.

The shirt reads "Did your gun kill a kindergartner today?" He said he actually bought two.

"The other one said, '"Could your gun kill a kindergartner?'" he said.

He said people misinterpreted the wording.

"I don't want to see anyone else subjected to such terror, and I'll stand up for gun control all the way," he said.

Myszka said as he listened to news about the shootings on the radio on Friday he just lost it.

"I shouldn't have to drive home two weeks before Christmas on Briley Parkway with tears rolling down my face when I hear about 20 kindergartners (being killed)," he said. "It's awful."
