The Telegraph's critics pick out the best films to watch on TV this New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> NEW YEAR'S EVE

The Sound of Music (1965)
BBC One, 3.10pm ****
It really does go on far too long but you can’t beat Rodgers and Hammerstein’s last collaboration for sheer enjoyable schmaltz and a song list of the kind of unimpeachable calibre to make Andrew Lloyd Webber blush. Ex-nun Maria (Julie Andrews) gets sent to look after the seven wayward children of the stern Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer), and finds she falls not only for the kiddiwinkles but von Trapp himself.

Catch Me If You Can (2002)
BBC Two, 7.00pm ****
Leonardo DiCaprio plays one of the Sixties’ most famous con artists, Frank Abagnale Jnr, in this charming and stylish, fact-based drama directed by Steven Spielberg. The film follows Abagnale Jnr as he manages to finagle millions of dollars by posing as a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, and a parish prosecutor, and still remain one step ahead of the FBI bank fraud agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks).

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010)
BBC One, 8.30pm; not Scotland ***
This is something of a rarity: a film based on a video game that’s actually quite entertaining. A bulked-up Jake Gyllenhaal plays Prince Dastan, who, after being framed for his father’s murder, teams up with a princess (Gemma Arterton) who just so happens to be the guardian of a magical dagger that can rewind time. Together, they try to safeguard it from a raft of baddies. 
 Julie & Julia (2009)
BBC Two, 9.15pm ****
Meryl Streep’s pitch-perfect impersonation of Julia Child – the cook who brought French haute-cuisine to middle-class America – may be lost on British viewers, who won’t be aware of the original chef. None the less, this tale about New Yorker blogger Julie Powell (played by the delightful Amy Adams), who sets out to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s 1961 cookbook, is a real charmer. Funny, warm and moving.

Bridget Jones’s Diary (2001)
ITV1, 10.00pm ***
American actress Renée Zellweger perfects her English accent to play the Chardonnay–swigging, chain–smoking, lovelorn Bridget Jones in this popular adaptation of Helen Fielding’s novel. Her ability to woo both her roguish boss Daniel Cleaver (a very amusing Hugh Grant) and stuffy–but–handsome lawyer Mark Darcy (a well–cast Colin Firth) is less convincing. Fielding’s third Bridget novel is due to be published in 2013.

NEW YEAR'S DAY

Dances with Wolves (1990)
BBC Two, 12.45pm ****
After his heroic exploits in the American Civil War, Union army lieutenant John Dunbar (played by Kevin Costner, who also directed and produced) chooses a solitary posting on the Western frontier, where he encounters – and is finally embraced by – the local Sioux tribe. This sort of thing rarely happened in reality, but the epic sweep of the tale and magnificent locations are irresistible.

The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Channel 4, 4.30pm *****
Few films are more fun to watch than MGM’s The Wizard of Oz, and few have the charming message, too. Judy Garland stars as Dorothy, bored with her drab, literally black-and-white existence (the opening and closing sequences are sepia-tinted), and desperate to escape to “somewhere over the rainbow”. Once she gets there, however, she discovers there is much more to life than selfish pleasures.

Up (2009)
BBC One, 6.30pm *****
A candidate for the finest film made by the Pixar Animation Studios, Up has a captivating story that realises the vividness of a child-like imagination. Only those with a heart of stone wouldn’t be moved by the story of a grumpy widower who tries to fulfil his dream of building a house next to Paradise Falls in South America. The film follows another Disney favourite, The Princess and the Frog (BBC One, 4.00pm).

Robin Hood (2010)
Channel 4, 9.00pm ***
Russell Crowe is reunited with director Ridley Scott for this prequel to the Sherwood Forest shenanigans of legend, but gone is their chemistry that made Gladiator such a glorious triumph. There’s still mud and blood aplenty, as Robin Hood roars his way through the aftermath of the death of Richard the Lionheart. Cinematographer John Mathieson has clearly been studying his Constable – his hay bales and twilit fields are gorgeous.

The Wooden Horse (1950, b/w)
BBC Four, 10.00pm ****
Jack Lee’s classic black-and-white film tells the astonishing true story of a group of Allied PoWs held captive by the Nazis, who hatch an audacious plan to use a vaulting horse to attempt escape. Filmed on location in Germany, just five years after the end of the war, this is a fascinating (if not fast-paced) film. It succeeds in creating a realistic sense of place, by focusing on the minutiae of everyday life. </span>
