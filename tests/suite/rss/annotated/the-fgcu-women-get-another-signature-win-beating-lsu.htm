		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">FORT MYERS, Fla. â€“ The FGCU women picked up a huge,  76-70, non-conference win over LSU Friday night at Alico Arena, thanks to career highs by three Eagles players.

With the win, FGCU improves to 7-5 overall and snapped the Tigers' four-game winning streak, while LSU falls to 8-4 on the season.

The win also gives the Eagles their second win (seventh all-time) over a BCS opponent this season.

The Eagles, who are 16th in the nation in three-point field goals per game (7.8) this season, knocked down seven shots from behind the arc, led by four 3's from senior Joyce Iamstrong.

Redshirt junior Sarah Hansen finished with a career-high and game-high 30 points, including a perfect 14-of-14 from the free throw line.

Senior Brittany Kennedy finished with nine rebounds, six assists and two steals to go with her career-high 20 points.

After the Tigers took a one-point lead (36-35) into the locker room at the half, FGCU opened the second period with a 10-5 run. 

FGCU would not fold and went on to outscore LSU 11-2 over the next 3:51 to take a commanding 70-64 lead with just over one minute remaining.

The Eagles win 76-70 and now open Atlantic Sun play on Monday, at Kennesaw State.</span>
