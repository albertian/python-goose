		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">A man, woman and teenager were forced to fight a bobcat when the wild animal attacked them on Sunday.

A bobcat sighting is not that unusual for the area, but an attack is extremely rare.

Roger Mundell has the battle marks to prove he went face-to-face with an unlikely intruder. It's a story that has left a Brookfield, Massachusetts family with a few scars.

"It only took a split second for him to be on me. I didn't have time to process it,' said Mundell.

When a bobcat found its way into the garage, it would stop at nothing to get out. First, the animal attacked Mundell.

"It hit me with it's face right here. Then it gave me a bear hug," said Mundell.
