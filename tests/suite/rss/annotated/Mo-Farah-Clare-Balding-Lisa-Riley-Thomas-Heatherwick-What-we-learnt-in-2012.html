		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Mo Farah, Clare Balding, Lisa Riley, Thomas Heatherwick: What we learnt in 2012
A group of individuals who this year saw their lives changed for ever talk to The Telegraph about their experiences of 2012.</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Mo Farah, Double Olympic champion

At the start of the year I had goals and targets. Now I have golds and memories. 2012 has been even better than I could have dreamt. The Olympics were perfect for me and then, to have that topped off with the birth of my twin daughters… I feel very blessed. If you keep working hard, the rewards will come. It’s this attitude I will keep with me as I move on to face new challenges.

From the athletics point of view, maybe crossing the line in the 5,000m to complete the double just edges the 10,000m, but there is very little in it. How can I put that ahead of seeing my beautiful baby girls born? All very happy times.

I’ve had to adapt my life since the Olympics, as I’m in the public eye now, but I hope that the people who knew me before still think of me as the same guy.

My New Year’s resolutions are to keep working hard, become a better athlete and learn another language – maybe French or Spanish.
Sue MacGregor, Writer and broadcaster

I’ll look back on 2012 as the year I found my Uncle Iain. Not him in person, but his grave in a peaceful military cemetery on the remote island of Ambon in Indonesia. He was in the RAF and died in 1943 as a prisoner of the Japanese in dreadful conditions. I managed to get to Ambon and put an English rose and a flaming red hibiscus on his grave. My only regret is that my mother, his sister, never knew where he’d ended up. The experience taught me how strong the emotional connection can be with someone you’ve never met.

How have I changed? Not enough, I fear. I am still terribly impatient. But the bad news is that as you get older, your faults apparently magnify.
John Whaite, Winner of The Great British Bake Off 2012

 (PA)

It’s been the best year of my life. Not only did I finish my law degree, which of course made my parents really proud, but I also won the third series of The Great British Bake Off. I’ve learnt that I’m impatient, and I can be erratic and impulsive. This year, though, has taught me the importance of letting things unfold naturally, rather than trying to force them. My favourite day was when I won the Bake Off. I wasn’t sure whether or not I should tell my grandparents about winning, but I spoke to my grandad who was elated. The next day, he suffered a brain haemorrhage, and I never got to speak to him again, so I’m happy that I made him proud that day. In January, I’m going to Le Cordon Bleu in London to study for my Patisserie Diploma, so my resolution is to learn as much as I possibly can, and to enjoy every minute of it.

On July 27 2012, the moment arrived when the seven young athletes took their flames and reached forward to light my studio’s cauldron in the Olympic stadium. After two years of planning, I took a deep breath and tried to go into a state of relaxation, knowing there was nothing more I could do. As the last of the 204 flames was lit, you could feel the bemusement of spectators at what appeared to be a flat cauldron sitting on the ground. But then there was the huge sense of relief when the copper pieces started to lift. That was the moment when the 80,000 people in the stadium gasped, and I felt the sound rush through me, in a way that I will never forget.

At about 1.30am on May 29 2012, my wife Cassandra Jardine, The Daily Telegraph feature writer and mother of our five children, died in her sleep, aged 57. She had spent the previous two years in a valiant struggle against lung cancer. For my children and me, 2012 has been life-changing.

I learnt that we should cherish and care for those we love because really they’re all we’ve got. The support of friends and Cass’s colleagues following her death, and my children’s wonderful contributions to their mother’s memorial service at St Bride’s, will always stay in my memory. Over the year I have become less ambitious, considerably older, perhaps more cautious, perhaps more chilled (not difficult). My New Year’s resolution is to do as Cass would have done – enjoy life.

Rachel Onasanwo, The 'happiest Olympic worker’



2012 was the year I discovered that people find me as funny as I find myself. Not only did I have one of the most fun jobs I’ve ever had, working at the Olympics, I got rewarded for doing that job with what I will call “fame”. People I didn’t know knew my name and they wanted to take their picture with me – all because of a video someone took of me just being me. I was entertaining the crowds that day but I had no idea so many people would share my sentiments. I’ve learnt that being yourself is the best you can be. I loved every minute of the Olympics. It was the friendliest I have ever seen London, and I can’t wait to have children so I can tell them about it and then tell their children about it, too.

This is the year in which I grew up. This might seem an odd thing to say as a mother of two, with a mortgage and a 15-year career. But when your 44-year-old husband comes home one day and says he’s got a rare, potentially incurable cancer, you suddenly realise that this is the moment when you can’t run away. I learnt that living with cancer isn’t always dramatic – it’s often terribly mundane. Dom and I ate Haribo and drank cheap wine the night he was diagnosed. The days before his regular scans, we usually argue about who’s loading the dishwasher to distract ourselves. When Dom wrote about having cancer for this paper’s Weekend section, I wondered how people would react. In fact, Twitter went absolutely mad; a million people saw the article the first day alone. Lots of people asked what they could do to help, including the novelist Alexander Masters and Liz Scarff, a social media consultant. They met with Dom – and the crowdfunding website iCancer (icancer.org.uk) was set up in just three weeks. I was so proud of them for taking a sad thing and changing it into something positive. I plan to raise a lot of glasses on New Year’s Eve, to slam the door on 2012 and look forward to the future, to see how much money we can raise for iCancer to fund research into a cure.

Catherine and Gareth Bull, Won £40.6 million on the EuroMillions jackpot on January 20 2012

2012 was one long roller coaster. More than anything, we have learnt to take our time and be patient. We are only young [Catherine is 35 and Gareth is 41] and don’t want to waste this opportunity, so we consider everything carefully before we decide to do something or buy something.

It is a great feeling to know you have helped out your parents and family, and their reactions have been special. Initially, we allowed ourselves to splurge – we bought a brand new car and a box at Old Trafford. We don’t think we have changed – our family and friends are still the same. For us, winning EuroMillions just changed our circumstances. We are lucky not to have any money worries and we love our life, so our plan for next year would be to continue as we are now, being happy and healthy.

Chris Robshaw, England rugby captain

Winning the Aviva premiership with Harlequins and becoming England captain are two moments that have made 2012 remarkable for me. I have spent my whole career with Harlequins, so captaining their first premiership win was one of the most gratifying experiences of my career. Singing God Save the Queen in my first home game as England captain was also a moving experience that I’ll never forget.

As captain you have to make decisions for your team in the heat of the moment. I have learnt that you have to take responsibility for those decisions, whether they turn out in your favour or not.

During the Autumn Internationals, many people wrote off our chances of winning against New Zealand after losing to Australia and South Africa. However, I never doubted we had the ability to beat New Zealand, who many people regard as the greatest team at the moment. (On December 1, England beat New Zealand 38-21.)

Next year I want to read more and stay off the pick ’n’ mix!

Nick D’Aloisio, App designer, aged 17



This year, I’ve been lucky enough to see something that I started as a hobby in my bedroom being used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.

While building Summly, my mobile app for browsing news articles, it has been my privilege to meet some of the world’s most experienced business men and women. All of them told me to stay focused and not get ahead of myself.

The reaction to the app has been tremendous, but it’s the first step in what I hope will be a long career. My education is still very important to me and I want to make sure I finish all my studies in 2013.

I’m pretty sure I’ll always look back on 2012 and think of it as the year everything changed for me.

Bryony Gordon, Journalist

 (Christopher Pledger)

This year I have covered an Olympics, reported on a Diamond Jubilee, and become a homeowner. As an aside, I also found out I was pregnant. I have been invited to Buckingham Palace, stood in the middle of the velodrome as Sir Chris Hoy won gold, and carried the Olympic torch. If I never have as momentous a year as this I will not complain – I have a feeling that from now on, I will need to conserve my energy for the little bundle I am expecting to arrive in 2013.

Frank Cottrell Boyce, Children’s writer and collaborator on Danny Boyle’s Olympics opening ceremony



I will look back on 2012 as the year we surprised the world and amazed ourselves. It was also the year I finally cleared out our shed. A favourite moment was catching the Tube at Bromley-by-Bow one evening a few months before the opening ceremony: it suddenly filled up with volunteers – all races, classes, ages, abilities, all clutching their bottles of water, all singing – and I thought, this is what a nation is. Britain is a project. After the ceremony my daughter said: “It feels like my daddy did all that just for me.” That was pretty good. After meeting engineers, technicians and choreographers at a rehearsal for the opening ceremony, my son said: “I hadn’t realised there were so many different ways to be brilliant.” That stuck with me, too.

Clare Balding, Television presenter

 (Julian Andrews)

Working on the Olympics and Paralympics in London 2012 was the highlight of my broadcasting career – I loved every second. Then my book, My Animals and Other Family, was published and went straight to number one, which was incredible. 2012 has been busy, exhilarating and unforgettable. I learnt that I can survive on less sleep than I previously thought, and my New Year’s resolutions are to keep challenging myself as a broadcaster and do my best to promote women’s sport, as I think it can change the world.

Lisa Riley, Actress, Strictly Come Dancing contestant 2012

 (BBC)

It has been an emotional year in every possible way. I lost my amazing mum – who was my best friend – and I miss her every single day. I believe that she sent me Strictly Come Dancing, during which I have had the best time of my entire career. I know mum is looking down on me and would be so proud of what I achieved on the programme. I have learnt that people should never judge a book by its cover, that I have a voice and I am entitled to use it. And it does not matter what size or shape you are – you can be who you want to be.

I hope I can give up smoking in the new year. I have done it before for three and a half months, but the stress of doing the Strictly tour might change that …
