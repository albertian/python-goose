		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The Florida Gulf Coast men's and women's basketball teams scored tough wins over North Florida on Monday at Alico Arena.

The men held an 18-point lead in the first half, only to see the Ospreys storm back to lead the game late.  But the Eagles, thanks to 5 players scoring in double figures, prevailed 75-73. With the victory, FGCU improves to 3-1 in A-Sun play.

On the women's side, a sluggish effort nearly cost the Eagles.  They shot just 30 percent for the game, but forced North Florida into 19 turnovers, and winning 53-42.  Senior Sarah Hansen led the way with 19 points, while Brittany Kennedy added 14 points and 5 assists and 3 steals. FGCU improves to 4-0 in league play.

Both FGCU teams keep streaks alive as well.  The men have yet to lose at Alico Arena this year, while the women extend their A-Sun winning streak to 22 straight games. </span>
