		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Naming winter storms - Whose idea was this?</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Actually, it was the Weather Channel's Idea... and it may not be a bad one.

Hurricanes get names. The Hurricane Center has been doing that since 1953. So why not snowstorms?

Each winter storm is unique. And giving them names will make them easy to follow, easy to remember and help the warning process.

Actually, naming winter storms is not that new an idea. It's done to some degree In Europe; Several TV meteorologists have done this in their local viewing area.

And in Buffalo, NY, the National Weather Service has been assigning names to to their winter Lake Effect snowstorms for more than 10 years.

The problem is the lack of standardization. The National Weather Service is unlikely to adapt to standards of a non-government agency.

Competitors to the Weather Channel, such as AccuWeather.com will not buy into the name game.

So depending on what channel, web-site or agency you favor for winter weather information, there may or may not be a name for the storm you are following. What may be a good idea will probably lead to a lot of confusion for a while.

In any case, the winner in this controversy is going to be the Weather Channel. Controversy means more publicity, which means more viewers, which means more ratings, which means more $$$$$</span>
