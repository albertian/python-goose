Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay is hoping that he can double the number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League and introduce Welsh derbies to England’s top flight next season. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> However, the former Celtic defender believes that there is no possibility of his former employers, or any other Scottish club, being allowed to compete south of the border during his lifetime.

While accepting that the presence of an institution the size of Celtic would be beneficial in a footballing sense, Mackay argues that there is too much at stake financially for the current members to risk losing a top-tier place as a consequence of their presence.

“I think the fact the Welsh teams have always been involved in the English league makes it different,” he said. “It’s generally accepted that if Celtic asked again …I don’t think it’s something in the short term that I’m going to see in football.

“It’s funny but we even need to ask for international clearance for loan deals because we’re Welsh. We had a wee issue last year because Wrexham were in the Conference and Swansea were in the Premiership so we were the only Welsh team in the Football League.

“That meant a loan from someone to Newcastle United to ourselves during the season was something Uefa stopped us from doing because we’re Welsh, although it was sorted out eventually. 


“As far as Celtic moving to England goes, I’m not sure it would be a good thing for Scottish football. And maybe the Premiership clubs would be against it because they look at what Celtic have done in Europe - and it then becomes a question of money rather than what might be good for the viewer.

“Without the money generated from the Premiership, Celtic’s player recruitment becomes so important. The wealth is in the Premiership. Any money in the Championship is from individual owners, there’s no TV wealth apart from a tiny slice of broadcasting money.”

Mackay praised the scouting set-up headed by John Park, which has allowed Celtic to reach the last 16 of the Champions League on a shoestring.

“For Celtic to get the funding to compete in the Champions League they’ve really got to search far and wide to find rough diamonds,” he said.

“I’m talking about the likes of Emilio Izaguirre or digging out a couple of Israelis because they can’t compete for, say, a Yohan Cabaye at £6 million from Lyon.

“They’re not playing on a level playing field, put it that way. I can understand from a business point of view why they keep knocking on the door and also, from a Scottish point of view, why everyone else wouldn’t want it to happen - you want the best teams to be playing in your country.

“There’s already a top division without Rangers in it and if Celtic were to go would the TV deal disappear all together? Or would it be a tiny deal for the rest of the clubs and could the rest then improve their infrastructure without that finance?

“It would become a diluted league with a lack of finances and there might even be a lack of interest in it outwith the local communities whereas, with the Old Firm, most of the country wants to watch.”

Meanwhile Celtic winger Kris Commons has welcomed the arrival of the SPL’s winter break, even though it has cut across his return from injury.

Commons returned after six games out with a thigh problem when Celtic completed the initial part of their title defence with a 1-0 win over Motherwell on Jan 2.

Celtic, nine points clear at the top of the table, had played two games each week since mid-November but the fortnight-long break means they should be fresh for their Champions League last-16 clash against Italian giants Juventus on Feb 12.

The Hoops, who are trying to sign Israel defender Rami Gershon from Belgium club Standard Liege during the January transfer window, are flying to Marbella on Spain’s southern coast for a training camp this week and Commons believes the break can only be good for the likes of Scott Brown, who has been playing with a hip problem.

“It will be like a mini pre-season and it will get our minds back in gear ahead of a few really big months,” the 29-year-old Commons told Celtic View.

“We have both domestic cups as well and we want to win them, so everyone has to be fit and ready to be called upon.

“We’ve struggled at times with injuries and had to patch people up but they’ve all worked hard to get to this break and give their bodies a rest.

“You look at Browny doing everything he can to play games, and he managed to get through them with good performances at the same time.

“That’s credit to him and how much he wants to play and win with the club - I admire that.

“He’s a role model in terms of his captaincy, leadership qualities and he sacrifices a lot of his own game to give the likes of me, Hoops (Gary Hooper) and Sami (Georgios Samaras) the freedom we need to express ourselves going forward.

“He’s the hard worker who does the nasty stuff not many people like to do and he does it so well, so he’s a pleasure to play with.”

Mackay was speaking at the Scottish FA's UEFA Pro Licence course at Hampden Park. Visit www.scottishfa.co.uk/coacheducation for information on all coaching courses available.
