		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">David Tanner focused on next generation of rowing talent despite unprecedented success
The least well-known of the four new Olympic knights will probably be greeted with "Happy birthday Sir David" on Saturday, as David Tanner CBE will celebrate his 65th birthday and the end of a remarkable year for his sport of rowing. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> He described the reward as "amazing". "It wasn't in my thinking at all," he said, "but it is a huge honour."

For 16 years and four Olympiads, Tanner has been the performance director and driving force behind GB Rowing, which won nine medals at its most successful ever Olympics this year, and broke new ground by winning the Paralympic coxed fours, as well as the first ever Olympic golds for British oarswomen. Under his aegis the GB rowing team has established a national training base, an army of coaches and support staff, and a racing record that is the envy of the world.

Tanner, a history teacher who became the headmaster of a large London comprehensive in the late 1980s, was a rowing coach for many years. He was senior GB team manager from 1991 to 1996, a voluntary job fitted into the school holidays. Then Di Ellis, chairman of the Amateur Rowing Association, asked him to apply for the new performance director role she was establishing.

"I left the headmastership to take this on," Tanner said. "What made the difference was that I could see the prospects of big Lottery funding about to begin. GB's only gold medal from Atlanta being in rowing gave me a head start. You could see the potential in the team but, without resources, we'd be limited. I'm a planner, but I can't write the script.

"The next step was a first Olympic podium place for the women [in 2000] and that remarkable gold-medal eight in Sydney." The number of medals won, and their spread across the team, began to grow. "I was just going in steps. We did it again with the [resurgent lightweight team] after Athens. 


"What am I most proud of? Building on the spirit there is in rowing, bringing in young rowers and building a stage around them on which they can perform. And the 'Start' programme to recruit athletes who hadn't rowed. It was a bit of a leap in the dark but has had an impact. We couldn't just rely on people popping up from rowing clubs and universities, however good they've been to us.

"Now we're quite a successful business, we have to keep renewing ourselves. We will keep doing things that have worked, and even if we can't win 14 Olympic medals in Rio, we will try."

Tanner is very pleased to have held on to his entire team of coaches after the Olympics, even any rival nation would welcome some of them. "It's all about making it sustainable, but that relies upon people," he said. "I couldn't do it without great people around me. That and organisation is a pretty heady mix of how you achieve something exceptional."

His wishes for the new year, as well as success for the next crop of rowers, are twofold. "I'd like to see the [UK] rowing clubs stronger, with good people running them. And I'd like to see a better domestic competition programme so that the top rowers are able to compete at home. The Diamond Jubilee Regatta was a good start to that."

And with that, the man who spent the day after the end of the 2012 Olympic regatta with junior rowers looking for the next generation's talent, is off to a TV interview. "I'm just as motivated as I've ever been," he said.
