Sir Alex Ferguson is considering a summer move to take Frank Lampard to Manchester United following Chelsea’s decision to allow the midfielder to leave Stamford Bridge at the end of his contract. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> Although Ferguson rejected the chance to sign Lampard last January after being sounded out about the possibility of taking the 34 year-old to Old Trafford, the prospect of signing him on a free transfer at the end of this season has prompted the United manager to identify the England international as a potential target to bolster his midfield options.

Ferguson, who is also planning a £16 million summer move for Borussia Dortmund forward Robert Lewandowski, has been a long-term admirer of Lampard, with his interest in the three-time Premier League winner dating back to a failed attempt to hijack Chelsea’s £11 million deal with West Ham United in 2001. In 2009 he went on record with his respect for Lampard, saying: “He is an exceptional player and a huge asset to his team.”

Lampard has repeatedly stressed his desire to remain at Chelsea beyond the end of this season, and he has been in impressive recent form, scoring four goals in his last five appearances to take him within nine goals of Bobby Tambling as the club’s all-time leading goalscorer.

Chelsea supporters have called for the club’s owner Roman Abramovich to reward Lampard’s service with a new contract, but the Russian has made it clear to the player and his representatives that there will be no offer of a new contract to stay at Stamford Bridge and the player is resigned to leaving.

It is understood that the prospect of playing for United would greatly appeal to Lampard. The move was ruled out by Ferguson 12 months ago due to the costs involved of paying a fee to Chelsea and also matching Lampard’s £150,000-a-week wages. The Scot had also already persuaded Paul Scholes to come out of retirement by the time the Lampard proposal was put to United. 


However, Ferguson believes that Lampard will be a much more attractive proposition when he becomes available for free this summer, particularly as there are issues surrounding several of his midfielders. There are doubts over the 38-year-old Scholes’s future beyond the end of this season, and concerns over the fitness of Darren Fletcher and Anderson.

Although Lampard will be 35 in June, the player’s age is not regarded as an issue by Ferguson, with his recent performances for Chelsea emphasising his fitness and continuing ability to perform at the highest level.

Ferguson has shown in the past, when recruiting the likes of Laurent Blanc, Edwin van der Sar, Michael Owen and the short-term signing of Henrik Larsson, that he values experience ahead of youth when the right player becomes available.

The Scot has also spoken of his admiration of AC Milan’s approach to senior players and the Italian club’s readiness to invest in players in their mid-thirties due to the qualities that they can add to a squad.

United’s success in prolonging the careers of Scholes and Ryan Giggs, who is expected to handed a contract that will see him play on beyond his 40th birthday later this year, also highlights their willingness to utilise players beyond the stage when rival clubs perceive them to have surpassed their usefulness. Ferguson would also expect Lampard to provide guidance for youngster Tom Cleverley, whose performances this season have made him one of the most highly-rated English talents in the top flight.

United will face competition should Ferguson pursue his interest in the player this summer, particularly from overseas, with LA Galaxy particularly keen to recruit a high-profile replacement for David Beckham. Arsenal have also been widely reported to be interested in him.

Crystal Palace’s highly-rated forward, Wilfried Zaha, is also being monitored by United, although Tottenham have emerged as their biggest rival for the 20 year-old. Palace are keen to resist moves for the player this month, while Zaha is eager to resolve his future before the transfer window closes on Jan 31.

However, it is understood that Palace would be open to a permanent deal for Zaha this month should it include a clause enabling the player to remain at Selhurst Park for the remainder of the season to help with their push for promotion from the Championship. No formal offer has yet been lodged with the south London outfit.

Meanwhile, United forward Wayne Rooney is understood to have been granted compassionate leave by the club following the death of Rosie McLoughlin, the 14-year-old sister of his wife Coleen.

Rooney is currently sidelined with a knee injury and has been ruled out of Sunday’s clash with Liverpool by Ferguson, but while the club have stressed that the Rooneys’ loss is a private matter, all support is being offered to the player at this time.

Why United need Frank: questions looming over midfield

Paul Scholes
The 38 year-old, having returned from retirement last January, faces an uncertain future, with doubts over whether he is prepared to stay on for another season at Old Trafford.

Darren Fletcher
The Scotland captain has overcome a debilitating bowel condition to return to the first-team squad, but has so far been able to make only seven senior appearances this season.

Anderson
Now in his sixth season at United, the Brazilian has been dogged by injury and is once again on the sidelines. Ferguson has shown great patience in the 24 year-old, but that is unlikely to last forever.

Tom Cleverley
At 23, Cleverley has broken into the England team, but his performances lack consistency and the experienced Lampard could be used as a mentor for the youngster while he builds his career at Old Trafford.
