BBC is 'ghettoising' children's programmes, warns Teletubbies creator
Anne Wood, who created Teletubbies, has voiced concern about the BBC's decision to move all children's programmes to children's channels.
</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> When the BBC children’s show Teletubbies hit television screens in the late nineties, it won over not only its target audience but also many teenagers and adults.

Such was the extent of its popularity that the theme tune, released as a single called Teletubbies Say Eh-oh, reached number one in the UK pop chart in December 1997.

But the programme’s creator has now warned that the broadcaster’s decision to cut children’s shows from BBC One and BBC Two and shift them on to channels dedicated to young viewers “ghettoises” them and sends the wrong message.

Anne Wood, who also produced the acclaimed children's television series In The Night Garden, said she had received many letters from older people who have enjoyed her programmes “as much as children do.”

The fact that children’s programmes attract a wider audience than people are aware of tended to be overlooked, she claimed. 


“A lot of the reason older people like to watch children’s programming is because it is life-enhancing,” she said.

The BBC has argued that the move will save money while also maximising audience figures for both the flagship and children's channels, CBeebies and CBBC.

But Wood suggested the decision was, although perhaps inevitable, a cynical move by a public service broadcaster with a diminishing interest in serving all of the public.

“It is dismissive of children,” she told Radio Times magazine, arguing that it “ghettoises children’s programmes.”

The move reflects a very different attitude to the one adopted in the past, which saw the 1960s children’s show Magic Roundabout aired before the 5.40pm news, she said.

The idea that making children’s programmes was an “art form” was also ignored, she claimed, expressing sadness that children’s shows had “just become fodder.”

Her dismay at the BBC’s decision was echoed by Jacqueline Wilson, the children’s writer.

The author of books including Bad Girls and Double Act said: “When children’s programming was on the ordinary BBC, one might catch a little of it by chance.

“And I’d think ‘oh, that’s very sweet, and perfect family viewing.’

“Whereas when children tune into CBBC or CBeebies, it’s a sort of dividing mechanism.”

A good children’s show does attract an adult audience as well, she agreed, fondly recalling an era when programmes like the Sunday afternoon serial were “something for the whole family to sit round and enjoy.”

Fellow children’s author Terry Deary was more positive about the move, however, hailing it as “progress” and “perfectly logical.”

Deary, who wrote the Horrible Histories series, said moving children’s programmes on to children’s channels “doesn’t matter at all.”

He rejected the word “ghetto” as a “very emotive word” that implies that children’s channels were inferior.

When television streaming goes fully online and becomes the way everyone views programmes, people will stop looking at channels in the “old, conservative way,” he predicted.

Joe Godwin, director of children’s BBC services, said: “Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already tune in to CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes.

“Far from being a 'cynical' move we are just following where our audience has already gone.

“It's simply not true that we're 'ghettoising' children's programmes - CBBC and CBeebies are the nation’s most popular children's television channels and we also know that lots of ‘former children’ enjoy sitting down with their own kids to watch our programmes.”
