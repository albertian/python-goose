Beleagured high street retailer New Look has reported strong sales growth over Christmas, suggesting that the debt-laden chain could be on the path to recovery.</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The private equity-owned retailer said UK like-for-like sales grew 3.7pc in the 14 weeks to December 29, with gross profit margins “significantly ahead” of last year as a result of tight stock management and less promotional activity.
Alistair McGeorge, chairman of the fashion chain that has debts worth £1.1bn, said customers had been “tactical” in their shopping, leaving most of their spending until later in the month, having searched for the best deal. Online sales are also up more than 50pc on last year, he said.
“The group has delivered an excellent result in a challenging trading environment, and this performance is a testament to the success of our recovery
programme and the strength of our brand,” he said. “Looking ahead we expect the economic outlook to remain challenging. However, we are confident in our ability to maintain the positive momentum being generated from the improved value of our ranges, our store refurbishment programme and continued growth of our online offer.”
In November, New Look reported a 3.3pc like-for-like sales fall for the first half of its financial year, as it struggled with competition from the likes of Primark and H&M. But Mr McGeorge said at the time that the retailer could return to like-for-like sales growth within six months and record its first profit for three years. He said the chain was planning to refinance its £1.1bn of debt in the next 18 months as part of a turnaround plan.</span>
