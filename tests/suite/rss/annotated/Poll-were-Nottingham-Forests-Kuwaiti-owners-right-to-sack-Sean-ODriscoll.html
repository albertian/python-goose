		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Poll: were Nottingham Forest's Kuwaiti owners right to sack Sean O'Driscoll?
Nottingham Forest's resounding win over Leeds left the club in eighth place, just one point adrift of the npower Championship play-off places. Yet, their manager Sean O'Driscoll was sacked in the aftermath. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> O'Driscoll is the latest casualty in the managerial merry-go-round, having left Crawley in the summer to take over at the City Ground.

But Forest's Kuwaiti owners are clearly intent on driving the club to the Premier League and reviving the success under legendary manager Brian Clough over 30 years ago. 


Indeed, the club have already confirmed that the club are keen to appoint a manager with Premier League experience - despite Forest chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi saying that the club "could not speak highly enough of Sean as a man".

So, were Forest's ambitious board right to sack O'Driscoll to see through their vision?

Or do you concur with Forest striker Billy Sharp, who responded to O'Driscoll's shock departure by tweeting: "gutted, that ruins a decent day".

Vote in our poll and have your say below...
