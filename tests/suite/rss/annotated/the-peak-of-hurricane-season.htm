		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">The peak of hurricane season</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The 2012 Hurricane Season's reputation is about to defined over the next 10 weeks. The so-called Peak of Hurricane Season runs from the send half of August through September and includes the first half of October. And the calendar says we are there.

The waters of the tropical Atlantic basin are at their warmest of the year these next 60 or 70 days. It is easier to get a hurricane to form during this time frame than any other part of the year and any other part of hurricane season.

As we begin our journey through the peak of the season, there is only one disturbance of interest. A brand new tropical depression has formed this evening about 1500 miles east of Florida.

It has a good chance of strengthening into a tropical storm and should take the name Gordon later tonight or tomorrow. But it has no chance of bothering the United States.

Steering winds over the Central Atlantic will carry this storm to the North and then toward the Northeast, far at sea.

Long range computer models are also looking encouraging. Neither model projects any other storm development between Florida and the coast of Africa for the foreseeable future.

We think Florida is safe from any tropical trouble for at least the next 7-10 days.
