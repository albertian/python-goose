		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">Miranda, BBC One, review
Michael Deacon reviews the return of Miranda (BBC One), the award-winning sitcom starring Miranda Hart. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2"> The lightest possible relief was to hand on BBC One, with the return of Miranda, the much-loved sitcom about a tall woman who falls over. Miranda is ideal for Christmas, having so much in common with panto anyway: slapstick, silly voices, harmless innuendo, characters breaking off to address the audience, jokes a child could get.

Fans will have felt snugly at home. As usual, our heroine (Miranda Hart), who runs a joke shop, was looking for love, getting picked on by her mother over her weight, and so on. In this episode she fell over twice, although there was a twist near the end, when she looked as if she was about to fall over but instead did a little dance.

So popular is Miranda that saying you don’t find it funny is a bit like saying you hate children, or indeed Christmas. Listening in silence to the ecstasies of the studio audience, I felt guilty, even ashamed. Why couldn’t I enjoy the simple pleasures of watching an unusually large woman fail to get a boyfriend? Did I think I was above laughing when she farted while dancing with a hunk, or squealed “Cheeky!” after a man said, “Let’s go over your particulars”?

Perhaps I’m just getting old. I’m sure I’d have loved this show when I was six. </span>
