A bitter feud over press freedom has sparked growing protest in China threatening to throw up the first major challenge to incoming president Xi Jinping. </span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">Celebrities, academics and other leading opinion formers have come out in support of one of the country's most respected and liberal papers which has been the subject of aggressive censorship by the authorities.

The crisis at the Southern Weekend newspaper exploded into the open last week after reporters accused the Guangdong province propaganda chief of transforming a lengthy newspaper New Year editorial calling for political reform into a gushing homage to China's Communist Party.

According to an analysis by the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project, the original editorial had argued Chinese citizens should be allowed to "voice their criticisms of power loudly and confidently".

The altered text, however, was less critical and was published under the headline: "We Are Now Closer to Our Dream Than Ever Before".

The censorship provoked an acrimonious dispute between government officials and journalists and was joined this week by celebrity online protests.
In a message posted on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo, actress Li Bingbing told her 19 million followers: "Hoping for a spring in this harsh winter." Fellow actress Yao Chen evoked the words of Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. "One word of truth outweighs the whole world," she wrote on her Weibo account which has nearly 32 million followers.

The influential Chinese blogger and author Han Han also lamented the newspaper's plight.

"Southern Weekend has informed me a lot as a reader. It gives power to the weak and hope to the hopeless," he wrote on Monday. "So, in its moment of weakness and desperation, I hope we can all lend them some strength, even if just a little, and help it carry on." Yesterday hundreds of people converged outside the Guangzhou newsroom of the Southern Weekend in a rare street protest. Photographs posted on social media showed demonstrators carrying signs calling for "free press, constitutional government and democracy".

David Bandurski, the China Media Project editor, said the "in your face [and] offensive" intervention by the local propaganda chief Tuo Zhen had proved the final straw for many of the newspaper's censorship-weary staff, who reportedly decided to go on strike on Sunday.

The newspaper's journalists believed propaganda officials had broken "a gentleman's code of how you do and don't control the media," Mr Bandurski added. "If they don't push back what will be left of their paper?"

The crisis at the paper had already escalated last Friday when journalists publicly slammed Mr Tuo's "brutal", "ignorant" and "catastrophic" intervention.

Dozens of leading academics then followed suit, using an open letter to call on Guangdong's new party chief, Hu Chunhua, to sack Mr Tuo for his "overbearing actions".

He Weifang, a legal expert from Peking University and one of the letter's signatories, said the incident was a "challenge to the new central leadership".

"So far they have not displayed their stance on political reform. This time, public anger may well test the new leadership." Several of the protesters who took to the streets outside the newspaper's Guangzhou HQ yesterday arrived yellow chrysanthemums in an apparent allusion to the death of press freedom.

One protester, Ah Qiang, told The Daily Telegraph the crisis was about more than newspapers.

"This involves not just one media outlet – Southern Weekend – but everyone. It is everyone's business. [It is about] everyone's rights," he said.

Mr Bandurski said the controversy now posed serious questions of the direction China was likely to move in under incoming president Xi Jinping.

"It is not just a media story anymore. It is about what direction China is heading in," he said.

"Ever since the 18th Communist Party Congress [Xi] has touted himself and the new top 7 leaders as representing a new style of leadership and this has been pushed very heavily by the state media." But while media reports had painted Xi as a "Spartan, no-nonsense and more open" leader, the so-called "New Year's Greeting" episode had led many to doubt that.

"These are signs that look right now like steps backwards not steps forward," Mr Bandurski said.

Mr He, from Peking University, said it was too early to say if Mr Tuo would be sacked or what consequences the newspaper's journalists might face.

But the central government's reaction would give an early indication of what ordinary Chinese could expect from their government over the coming decade, he added.</span>
