		<span class = "x-nc-sel1">US politics and election: 2012 review
This was the year that Barack Obama secured a second term in office thanks to his own ultra-efficient election machine, a weak opponent in Mitt Romney and a Republican party that appeared unable to hold the middle ground of American politics.</span>
		<span class = "x-nc-sel2">The writing was on wall for the Republicans early in 2012, as the primary season opened to reveal a cast of essentially fringe characters.
There was Newt Gingrich, the loquacious former Speaker who wanted to build a hotel on the moon; Rick Santorum, the evangelical Catholic who said the separation of church and state made him want to ‘throw up’ and the heavyweight early favourite, Texas governor Rick Perry who, when asked which three federal agencies he planned to shut down, was unable to remember them. “Oops,” he said. Indeed.
That left Mitt Romney as the last man standing: a moderate former governor of Massachusetts who, by the time the campaign began in earnest in June, had been forced so far to the right on abortion, taxation and women’s issues that he was never able again to command the centre-ground.
The result – despite brief resurgence after the first presidential debate in Denver and some wishful-thinking that the polls were all flawed – was ultimately predictable.
Just as the polls (and the New York Times’s Nate Silver) had suggested, the Republicans lost the popular vote for the fifth time in six elections, with Mr Obama winning by 3.7pc overall, taking the Electoral College by an even more convincing 332 votes to 206.
The scale of Mr Obama’s victory among minorities and women – he captured unmarried women by 38 points, 93 per cent of the Black vote and 70 per cent of the Hispanic and Asian voters – pointed to a potentially seismic shift in the US political map as America embraced a new, browner, more liberal demographic reality.
In legacy terms, Mr Obama’s victory cemented the “Obamacare” health reforms that Mr Romney had vowed to reform, and probably heralded immigration reforms ahead.
Within days of the election Mr Romney, loved by neither the grassroots nor the party grandees in Washington, had faded to obscurity and soul-searching had begun among Republicans about how the party could recapture the middle ground.
The broad shift in American society was reflected in two other emerging trends: the growing acceptance of gay marriage, which Mr Obama publicly came out and publicly supported in May; and the growing strength of the movement to legalise marijuana as Washington State and Colorado both used a side-ballot in the November General election to legalise recreational pot smoking.
2012 was also the year of the Clintons. Former President Bill made by far the best speech of the political campaign at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, delivering a scintillating performance that even beating the opening night of the NFL American football season in the television ratings.
His wife, Hillary, also completed her last year as Secretary of State, but her swansong was marred by the bitter recriminations that followed the death of the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans in the September 11 assault on the US consulate in Benghazi.
The fallout from the security and intelligence failings – and the whether the White House tried to white-wash Al Qa’eda’s role in the attacks to preserve its political narrative that the terrorist network was defeated – looks set to spill over into 2013. It also derailed Mr Obama’s hopes of nominating Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations as Mrs Clinton’s successor.
Within weeks of his November 6 victory, Mr Obama was back on the campaign trail, appealing to public opinion over the heads of Republicans for support for his plans to raise taxes on the well-off, as negotiations continued to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
As the Christmas tree lights burned on National Tree on the south side of the White House, it was still far from clear if a deal could be struck by New Year Eve, when $600bn of spending cuts and tax increases threatened to get 2013 underway with an economic whimper.</span>
