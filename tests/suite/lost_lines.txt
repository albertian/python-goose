It has felt like a spotty year during which we were left watching the further decline of a once-mighty manufacturing empire As Disney s wretchedly cluttered space epic John Carter crashed and burned the Hollywood studios looked to have forgotten how to make the sure things that were once its bread-and-butter Worse they seemed to have forgotten how to market them: Ridley Scott s quiet eerie design-rich Prometheus turned out to be more art installation than the commercial horror it was so aggressively sold as One sensed the mainstream struggling to manage our expectations let alone surpass them The default position for 2012 s bigger releases was either nostalgia (from Spielberg s muted War Horse to Tim Burton s larky Dark Shadows) or novelty (found footage 3D high-definition 48 frames per second) When the 70mm format was revived for Paul Thomas Anderson s The Master it helped that the film was big and mysterious enough not to need the gimmickry There were teen-oriented hits as ever: Avengers Assemble Ted The Hunger Games Yet some old reliables (Christopher Nolan s Batman reboots the Twilight saga) came to an end and the muted response to Peter Jackson s The Hobbit only left one wondering: where now Such a question was also posed closer to home once Harry Potter was finally put to bed late in 2011 Yet the British industry appeared in renewed good health a diagnosis confirmed when Skyfall overtook Avatar to become the biggest ever film at the UK box office Having Daniel Craig appear during the London 2012 opening ceremony was felicitous PR though the Olympian spirit also empowered Julien Temple s superbly energetic collage London: The Modern Babylon and two films emerging from the East End: Dexter Fletcher s overlooked Wild Bill and the cheeky Cockneys vs Zombies (which sent the undead shuffling after Richard Briers) Farther afield there were masters at work From Turkey came Once Upon a Time in Anatolia Nuri Bilge Ceylan s searching police procedural; from South Africa the arresting Beauty a queer Vertigo; and from Russia Aleksandr Sokurov s one-of-a-kind Faust The Hungarian great B la Tarr bowed out with The Turin Horse an apocalypse in slow motion Yet it was a quiet year for French cinema the much-lauded Amour and Holy Motors striking me as respectively bullying and baffling The year s real highlights though came in non-fiction This was the best year for documentary in living memory: as the mainstream lurched towards the fantastical these films formed a vital countermovement nudging us back in the direction of actuality Sometimes the appeal was narrative verve (Bart Layton s The Imposter better told than 99 per cent of this year s studio output) often it was pure spectacle (Wagner s Dream illustrating Robert Lepage s attempts to stage the Ring cycle at New York s Metropolitan Opera) And occasionally it was downright nosiness as with Lauren Greenfield s standout The Queen of Versailles which aped reality TV in its study of America s 1 Percent until the recession bit and it became a very different story So strong was the documentary field that one could pick double-bills of favourites like the summer hit Searching for Sugar Man and its shadow-movie Lawrence of Belgravia cocking a joint-snook at the Cowell-iverse and canonising music s continued confounding ability to evade those structures the record industry would place around it Elsewhere two hugely moving art-world profiles Marina Abramovic: the Artist is Present and Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry showcased invention courage and craft enough to power a thousand movies This at last was the kind of heroism one longed to see more of in mainstream cinema And it was real Follow Telegraph Film on Twitter

New spending on credit cards climbed to 7 3bn in November from its six-month average of 7 1bn the British Bankers Association (BBA) said However consumers continued a long-running trend of paying back more than they put on their plastic with 7 5bn made in repayments during the month The BBA said that outstanding levels of non-mortgage borrowing contracted by 2 3pc over the year to November driven by a significant shrinking back of personal loans and overdrafts Meanwhile 33 634 mortgage approvals for home buyers worth 5 3bn were recorded in November marking the highest number seen since January This continues a trend of steady increases seen in recent months which analysts have put down to a multibillion pound Government scheme aimed at boosting lending to households and businesses which was launched in August However the BBA said that net mortgage lending has gradually reduced to a "flat balance" amid high repayments being made by home owners on their mortgages as they take advantage of low interest rates to cut down their debt Gross mortgage lending totalled 7 7bn in November but almost the same amount 7 5bn was made in repayments The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said earlier this month that one third of mortgages taken out since 2005 have been overpaid The BBA said that inflows into cash Isas have remained strong this year as people have sought accounts paying better rates of interest leading to a 6 3pc rise in all personal deposits over the year to November BBA statistics director David Dooks said: "Households are continuing to repay virtually as much as they borrow and as people hold on to cash deposits are growing by 6pc annually "The situation is not dissimilar in the business world - businesses are holding back investment or expansion plans and building up cash reserves " Families budgets are expected to come under further pressure next year from increased costs including soaring energy bills following a string of price hike announcements Research from financial information company Markit has found that three-quarters of households believe their finances will worsen or at best stagnate in 2013 The BBA also said that net lending to non-financial businesses recorded a 3 1 billion decrease in November Its report said firms are continuing to reduce their debt as they wait for more certain trading conditions and a rise in customer and market confidence Source: PA

Take a look at the local temperatures all in the 20s and even teens The high today at Reagan National so far is 25 degrees 3:14pm: Chatting with the team in here we are all confident that the majority of the snow will be exiting the D C Metro close to 7pm The last of it currently is over eastern portions of West Virginia 3:06pm: Here is a quick video by Senior Meteorologist Bob Ryan 2:53pm: At least D C just has to deal with all snow In North Carolina a lot of the state is contending with freezing rain sleet and snow The dreaded wintry mix Icing will make for much nastier commutes in those areas As I went to school at N C State in Raleigh I know how much winter precipitation and shut down that city! 2:50pm: Here s a live webcam at the University of Maryland Thanks to our friendly twitter user @Terpweather for the find 2:44pm: HD weather cameras are showing snow through the majority of the D C area It remains dry south of D C where a bit of a dry slot has been moving through It shows up rather nicely on our Doppler 2:37pm: I wanted to thank you for all of your reports on our facebook page as well as on the comments below we appreciate the ground truth reports when all we have to go by are what the surface observation stations are telling us Visibility will be an issue in some of the heavier snow showers and a few slick spots may develop rather quickly in the heavier bands so be careful when it s time to head home for the day This is D C after all so you know we re all in for afun commute home! 2:10pm: Flurries to light snow is now being reported in many areas across the Metro and points north and west This band will continue to affect the region with the heaviest snow showers north and west of the city 1:40pm: Our very own meteorologist Lauryn Ricketts has been getting reports from some of her followers and friends in the Shenandoah Valley area of light snow now falling there Winchester Woodstock and Front Royal have all seen a few flakes out there Keep the reports coming in! 1:03pm: Dewpoint depressions (or the difference of degrees between the temperature and dewpoint) are high right now which will be the big problem as the region still needs a lot of saturation to occur at low levels in order for snow to fall This also leads us to say that this will be another dry snow event so it appears if it does snow it will at least once again be sweepable 12:52pm: Checking out our Live Doppler Radar right now there is a nice "snow hole" as everyone likes to call it though it s really just the atmosphere waiting to saturate You have to remember that as the beam gets farther away from the radar it is hitting objects higher up as the beam has a tilt to it In this case it is hitting snow or ice crystals higher in the atmosphere (virga which is evaporating before reaching the ground) but you can tell it isn t seeing anything at lower levels closer in to the city 12:29pm: Frederick MD is now reporting snow There is also snow showing up in our live camera in western Frederick County at St John Regional Catholic School 12:15pm: Here s a good find from our friend Dave Johnson of a traffic cam showing I-68 east of Cumberland MD Very slick driving conditions there 12:00pm: Pavement temperatures are just about all below freezing throughout Maryland Light snow or flurries have also been reported in Martinsburg WV 11:43am: Snow is already falling in the higher elevations far west of D C in Western Maryland Be sure to check our HD Weather Cameras above to see if it s snowing closer to your area! 11:18am: Snow is trying to make it into our region during these late morning hours but the low-level atmosphere is still very dry with dewpoints mainly in the single digits This snow is evaporating as it falls and is something we call "virga" I assume we will begin to have a few reports of light snow developing in the Panhandle of West Virginia and the mountainout areas to the west but it will take a while for the region to reach saturation so snow won t move into the D C area until much later this afternoon

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a letter to congressional leaders that the department will use accounting measures to save approximately $200 billion which could keep the government from reaching the limit for about two months The move comes as President Barack Obama and the Republican congressional leadership are locked in negotiations over how to avoid a series of tax increases and spending cuts known as the "fiscal cliff " that are scheduled to take effect in the new year Mr Obama has sought to include an increase in the borrowing limit in the talks But House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders have demanded concessions in return The negotiations hit a stalemate last week Mr Obama has cut short his Christmas holiday in Hawaii to return to Washington to resume talks Mr Geithner said the negotiations over tax and spending policies made it difficult to predict how long he can delay reaching the borrowing limit The borrowing limit is the amount of debt the government can pile up The government accumulates debt in two ways: It borrows money from investors by issuing Treasury bonds and it borrows from itself mostly from Social Security pensions In 2011 Congress raised the limit to nearly $16 4 trillion from $14 3 trillion Three decades ago the national debt was $908 billion But Washington spent more than it took in and the debt rose steadily - surpassing $1 trillion in 1982 then $5 trillion in 1996 It reached $10 trillion in 2008 as the financial crisis and recession dried up tax revenue and as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and other programs In August 2011 the rating agency Standard & Poor s stunned the world by stripping the US government of its prized AAA bond rating because it feared that America s dysfunctional political system couldn t deliver credible plans to reduce the federal government s debt S&P decried American "political brinksmanship" and concluded that "the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge " Source: AP

Failing NHS bosses will go - Jeremy Hunt Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned NHS managers cannot expect to keep their jobs if they preside over failings in care Mr Hunt writing in the Sunday Telegraph said "proper accountability" was needed in the health service He was writing ahead of a report into failings at Stafford Hospital which is expected to be published within months There were hundreds more deaths than expected at the hospital between 2005 and 2009 Some of those deaths were caused by the failings at the hospital A public inquiry has been looking at how the failures in care were allowed to happen by managers and regulators Ahead of its report Mr Hunt called for "total openness and transparency when things go wrong" and a change of culture to give greater priority to compassion Happy staff "Just as a manager wouldn t expect to keep their job if they lost control of their finances nor should they expect to keep it if they lose control of the care in their organisation either " he went on "And that means above all happy and motivated staff - something that is always a priority in successful NHS organisations or indeed any other organisation as well Continue reading the main story The stories that have emerged from the Stafford Hospital scandal have been horrifying But this is about much more than one bad hospital It goes to the heart of the NHS Why and how is a culture of poor care allowed to develop in some corners of the NHS and then persist Stafford was monitored by local and regional health managers and a host of patient safety agencies and regulators Doctors and nurses working there were part of professional bodies We know from recent reports from the likes of the Patients Association and Care Quality Commission that such lapses are not unique to this one hospital Many are now hoping the Francis Inquiry will provide a clear vision for how such poor standards can be eradicated once and for all "Most of all we need a change of culture "Patients must never be treated as numbers but as human beings indeed human beings at their frailest and most vulnerable " The Patients Association backed Mr Hunt s comments saying "managers and boards must be held accountable for what goes on within their trusts and the appropriate action must be taken" The inquiry established by the coalition in 2010 and chaired by Robert Francis QC sat for 139 days cost 10m and considered about a million pages of evidence It was prompted by a 2009 Healthcare Commission (HC) report which listed a catalogue of failings including receptionists assessing patients arriving at A&E and a shortage of nurses and senior doctors Managers were found to have been distracted by targets and cost-cutting and regulators were accused of failing to pick up problems quickly enough despite warnings from staff and patients Mr Hunt said the events at Stafford represented "the most shocking betrayal of NHS founding values in its history" He pledged to introduce a system of patient feedback - which would be published - whereby every hospital in-patient will be asked whether they would recommend the care they received to family or friends Robust recommendations BBC health correspondent Branwen Jeffreys says the inquiry report may well call for a rethink on the regulation of healthcare although our correspondent says there could be a limited appetite for that within government as the NHS in England is in the middle of a massive reorganisation Julie Bailey whose mother Bella died in Stafford hospital spearheaded the campaign Cure the NHS which demanded the government hold a public inquiry She told the BBC that only "robust recommendations" from Mr Francis would solve the problems at Stafford hospital and in the wider NHS "We want to see a quality and safety system implemented "The regulation of doctors and nurses did not achieve anything; nobody has been held to account for those failings " Katherine Murphy chief executive of the Patients Association said: "The changes necessary will only be achieved through a change in attitude and a commitment from management to training and adequate staffing levels all within a culture of transparency and accountability - and the patients need to be put at the centre of the service " Anna Dixon director of policy at the Kings Fund a charity that works to improve healthcare in England said: "Regulation plays a vital role in safeguarding the quality of patient care but most crucial is frontline staff who need support to do a good job and to speak up and take action when needed " Terrible care Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust looks after Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals Continue reading the main story Personal stories: Deb Hazeldine Deb Hazeldine told the BBC about the death of her mother at Stafford Hospital Her mum Ellen was admitted to the hospital in July 2006 after a fall at home She was in remission from bone cancer During her stay she contracted a hospital superbug which led to her death in December 2006 "The things I saw on the wards will probably haunt me forever "My mum was left without food fluids she was unable to get to the toilet " she said Furthermore there was a mix-up at the hospital mortuary in which the undertakers were handed forms saying that Ellen s body was highly infectious so people should not be allowed to see her In the end Deb did see her - but only for a few minutes when she was in a body bag Last month a panel appointed by the regulator Monitor said the trust was "unsustainable" in its present form Lyn Hill-Tout chief executive at the trust said in a statement: "The Care Quality Commission lifted all concerns it had about Stafford Hospital in July 2012 "Our mortality rates are second best out of 41 Trusts in the Midlands and East of England region and have been consistently better than the level expected for the last few years "None of our patients has acquired MRSA infection in hospital since February 2012 and our Clostridium Difficile rate continues to fall year on year " She added that nursing standards had been improved by the introduction of ward sisters and staffing levels were constantly monitored to ensure enough trained staff are on duty at all times "The terrible care received between 2005 and 2009 is not representative of the care patients now receive in our hospital "We are not complacent we know we don t get it right every time but we do not hide the facts when things are not as good as what we would want them to be "

Spit test improves asthma care A simple spit test could identify thousands of children with severe asthma who are taking medication which will never help them scientists say One in seven people will not respond to salmeterol found in purple or green inhalers which is given to tens of thousands of children in the UK A study of 62 children showed those patients could be identified and given effective treatment The results were published in the journal Clinical Science Salmeterol which is found in Seretide and Servent inhalers is used to relax the airways in the lungs It is taken by children who cannot control their asthma just with a blue inhaler which is given to all children when they are diagnosed with asthma The reason why some children do not respond to salmeterol is hidden in their genetic code The drug acts on beta-2 receptors in the airways however one in seven people have a genetic mutation resulting in their receptors being a slightly different shape which the drug struggles to recognise DNA taken from a child s spit can be tested to reveal the shape of their beta-2 receptor and whether salmeterol will work Striking The study by the Brighton and Sussex Medical School and the University of Dundee looked at 62 children with the mutation Half were given salmeterol and the other half were given an alternative asthma drug montelukast The researchers said the difference was "pretty striking" as symptoms improved and children had less time off school Prof Somnath Mukhopadhyay said: "For almost every clinical outcome we were looking at we found that salmeterol either wasn t working or was working very poorly Montelukast was very much better "We ve shown for the first time that personalised medicine can work in the field of childhood asthma " He said the test which is not yet available for use in GPs surgeries would cost about 15 and that it was "unacceptable" to give children drugs which did not work Prof Mukhopadhyay added: "It s a common disease affecting a million children in this country a common medicine is probably not working in a significant proportion of the population "I think we need to get some guidance from lead charities and from the Department of Health " Really encouraging The exact number of children who have the mutation and are taking the drug is unknown but could be up to 15 000 in the UK Continue reading the main story Analysis: Making the future personal Personalised medicine is one of the great hopes for the future of healthcare Instead of treating all patients with the same disease with the same treatment doctors would analyse each patient s genetic code to see which treatment would work best Genetics has shown that breast cancer is not one disease but at least 10 - each with a different cause and needing a different treatment In the future it s hoped doctors will look at the DNA inside a tumour before choosing which treatment to offer Herceptin is already used only in patients who will respond to it Doctors believe they have now demonstrated the first use of personalised medicine in childhood asthma and it s likely similar tests will be developed for a range of diseases Responding to the study Malayka Rahman from the charity Asthma UK said the results were "really encouraging" but more research was needed before a decision could be made on introducing such a test "This exciting area of research has the potential to lead to the tailoring of better treatments for an individual based on their own genetic make-up; ultimately keeping more people out of hospital and preventing unnecessary asthma deaths in the long-term " The Department of Health welcomed the research and said looking at genes may one day be used to tailor treatments However a spokesperson said more work still needed to be done before that stage was reached Anna Murphy consultant pharmacist and Royal Pharmaceutical Society spokesperson said: "The study itself was designed to prove that a child s genetic make-up can have an impact on the effectiveness of treatment rather than to advise on the specific treatments we use for children with asthma "Therefore it would not be responsible to change prescribing practice at this time " She said parents who were concerned should speak to their pharmacist or doctor Prof Stephen Holgate from the University of Southampton said the results were "impressive" and were a "wonderful example" of personalised medicine getting closer to the GPs surgeries "The gene-based test is not yet available to doctors but should become so if larger trials are equally positive "

The New Year Honours list is really the Government s New Year Favours Returned list and no knighthood reveals that more than Hector Sants the final chief executive of the Financial Services Authority now turned banker once again with Barclays To be fair toiling in the engine room of financial services regulation from 2004 being appointed FSA chief executive in 2007 can hardly have been a laugh-a-minute career move for a highly successful former Credit Suisse investment banker Indeed so fed up with the job was Sants that he quit in 2010 only to have the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the blower pleading with him to stay and see through the Coalition s regulatory shake-up which is returning power to the Bank of England through the creation of the Prudential Regulatory Authority Sants duly bowed to the Chancellor s powers of persuasion and spent a further two years in regulatory service which he finally quit in June But at its heart are two transparent contradictions How can the Government strip Fred Goodwin of his knighthood and effectively hand it to the man whose organisation failed to stop Goodwin s catastrophic ambitions in the first place But also how can the Government reject the Financial Services Authority and its track record to the extent that it has passed legislation to abolish the regulatory body yet still award its chief executive a knighthood an honour which bestows official recognition of a job well done The award rings hollow which is regrettable for Sants But the track record of the FSA (RBS et al) simply does not justify knighthoods or any other official honours Likewise the moves to dismantle it Sants has his reward elsewhere as a gamekeeper turned poacher with a new job at Barclays as head of compliance and a multi-million pound pay package Helping clean up this organisation to change it forever would be the task worthy of a gong not running a tarnished bureaucracy however tough the ride

Is it over yet By Hurricane Expert Jim Reif By Hurricane Expert Jim Reif With 18 days left in the season and only 3 more names left till we run out of 2012 names It s a fair question The answer --- we re probably done The water either side of Florida has cooled significantly and cool fronts have gone all the way into the Western Caribbean But more significantly is the rip-roaring wind shear that dominates the Atlantic basin Even if a bubble of low pressure tried to organize in the tropics that wind shear would quickly tear it apart So the final tally will look something like 19 named storms for this 2012 season 10 of them grew into hurricanes but only one (Michael) became a major storm And just to show you how difficult it is to make a seasonal hurricane forecast I ll cite the example of Dr Bill Gray and his team at Colorado State Over the years he s been the best of the bunch But this year back in April his team predicted only 10 named storms for 2012 in a slightly quieter than normal hurricane season Whoops

This year has proved to be another successful one for our financial agony aunt Jessica Gorst-Williams Over the past 12 months she has clawed back almost half a million pounds for our readers from banks insurers and other companies Week by week in her Jessica Investigates and Ask Jessica columns which appear in the Saturday and Sunday Telegraph she has taken up the cudgels on behalf of readers tackling what appear to be intransigent problems that have often dragged on for months Below she details some of her more memorable cases and outlines what lessons can be learnt from the financial problems she has tackled in 2012 Over the year I reported how 450 669 had been extricated from banks claimed from insurance companies located in lost savings accounts or obtained from other companies This doesn t include any savings readers may have made by following my advice themselves Among the most satisfactory results are those that exceed expectation DC of Cornwall had written in seeking 8 000 from Aviva as it had not notified him that his pension fund had been earning paltry interest rather than the 6pc per year he thought he was getting DC had tried to keep abreast of the interest rate being paid with a view to moving his money if it dipped When he found out just how much he was getting Aviva was tardy in providing transfer forms Having not factored this in when considering the case earlier Aviva now agreed to make good all DC s losses These were totted up according to an agreed formula and came somewhat surprisingly to 18 201 which was paid into his fund Several readers found that extracting their savings from banks could seem like drawing teeth IC of West of England had no idea how much the elderly relative he is acting for had with Santander He was initially told she had a single account which didn t seem quite right He had tried to get redress from the Ombudsman but eventually on the prompting of a solicitor contacted me More accounts then came to light with a combined sum in them of 58 775 far more than IC had anticipated In addition Santander paid 4 643 to cover the interest that had been added to IC s credit card bill as well as the 1 140 solicitor s bill 250 for goodwill plus 266 to reflect the fall in value of a shares Isa included among the various savings account This all made for a 65 074 resolution Debilitating illness had prevented LS of Essex from pursuing her work as a dental hygienist A policy now with Phoenix Life had what is known as a "waiver of pension premiums provision" which ensures that payments will continue to be made into the pension fund if you are unable to work through ill health Units should have been added to the fund but had not been LS had been unable to put her finger on what was wrong In all my involvement led to 6 859 being added to the fund Instances of fraud in various guises cropped up with disturbing regularity with many problems caused by cold callers fake emailers and card scams RM of Surrey had been on a business trip in Shanghai After a restaurant meal he disputed the bill which came to an exorbitant amount Then the situation became threatening and he paid as he thought the equivalent of 193 by card The receipt was blank and RM alerted Barclaycard which he found unhelpful When he received his statement the debit was for 1 934 Barclaycard initially refused to pay the claim I argued that had he taken a more aggressive stance his personal safety could have been jeopardised and as his travel insurance is with Barclays that could have been much more costly for the bank This led to Barclaycard refunding the 1 934 plus interest albeit with no admission of liability Often the most traumatic issues stemmed from household disasters PC of East York s family s life remained on hold following a fire at his home After something of an uphill struggle I eventually managed to get the insurer Equity Red Star to pay more than 24 000 which adequately covered the aspects of the claim PC had written in about Meanwhile RD of Dorset s sister was being pestered over a 3 960 hotel bill which had not been paid by Halifax Insurance four months after she had returned to her home after having to vacate it because of water damage Seventeen letters later RD approached me and that and other bills totalling 4 132 were paid at last Travel insurance dramas I reported on during 2012 included the experience of DH aged 76 of County Londonderry He had been a passenger on a bus in Spain while on a business trip when a fire extinguisher exploded near his face coating him in a fire-retardant powder that left him he reported looking like a snowman The police took him to a garage to blow the substance off with a compressor Despite DH s stalwart efforts to get redress for a ripped jacket air travel and hotel along with medical reports (the incident exacerbated chest problems he already had) Allianz Spain the bus company s insurer only agreed to settle after my involvement 2 514 was paid on account of the injuries and 418 for the other categories JV of Dorset s problem revolved around a laptop case containing a computer and some jewellery which was stolen during a train journey in Switzerland Having rejected the claim beforehand my involvement led to Axa Insurance conceding that it was unreasonable to expect JV to look at the laptop case for the full duration of the journey and settling for 1 000 My intervention has also led to various terms and conditions being changed which should have an impact on the wider public The Department of Work and Pensions said it has amended processes because of a case involving the non-payment of winter fuel allowance to JL of Cornwall s mother This led to her receiving a payment of 1 900 A decade before writing in JK of Surrey had tried to increase the couple s critical illness cover under a clause that allowed more to be bought without new underwriting where there was a "significant event" such as becoming parents The company now under the Phoenix brand had not let JK do this because the child was adopted after she was one year-old The policy conditions stipulated the child must be under 12 months old at the time of the request to expand cover JK had to acquire extra insurance sourced elsewhere at a less-favourable price My involvement led to Phoenix Life reimbursing the additional 3 600 cost of cover and agreeing to make positive changes to ensure that others aren t similarly disadvantaged GW of Lancashire lost out while switching his investment into cash because of a quaint rule whereby a faxed request such as he had made was held back while postal instructions played catch-up I argued that the initiative of getting the request in sooner by fax was to be applauded rather than penalised The insurer Sun Life Financial of Canada took on the point made good the 966 shortfall and is looking into making its process more flexible In another turnaround Santander agreed after I contacted it to abide by a promise given by its predecessors to continue to provide free banking for certain existing business banking customers MC of Scotland s problems with the Bank of Scotland telephone banking service led to a pilot test whereby the voice request will ask for digit number five rather than the fifth digit which was sometimes being confused with the sixth As usual petty mistakes over names addresses and figures proliferated Some people were pursuing small sums that really did not seem worth the candle I mentioned WH of Essex s crusade over a 1 90 discrepancy in a telephone bill I dealt with several cases about uncashed cheques MG of Kent representing her 84-year-old sister explained how three years earlier she had found a number of distribution cheques issued by the Santander Asset Management Unit Trust that hadn t been presented for payment Since then she had been pushed from pillar to post trying to realise the funds By the time she came to me most of the money had been credited back to the unit trust for the benefit of all investors as allowed under the prospectus Recognising how long MG had been pursuing this the bank refunded the cheques even those outside this time limit giving her a total of 1 017 in all Depressingly I continued to receive many letters about mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) and other financial products I wrote how Barclays was persuaded to pay out 8 592 after it sold the Aviva (Morley) Global Cautious Income fund This is designed to be a medium to long-term investment product but the customer had died a year later at the age of 70 The bank had stated there was a "requirement for high regular income for social life" This did not quite tally with the client s long history of ill health which meant he had had chemotherapy had not worked for a few years prior to his retirement had not used his car for a few months before his death and was undergoing medical investigations for a heart condition Sadly good news stories were few and far between but one or two brightened the otherwise bleak financial landscape Prudential for example announced that customers who had paid premiums on certain whole-of-life insurance policies for 40 years would not have to pay a penny more but would continue to have cover It would be nice to see other insurers follow its lead in the new year Please address

Jim Reif: Score one for the geeks The forecast cone for Sandy from 5 p m on October 25th When I was a meteorology student at Penn State many (many) years ago I quickly learned that there were two types of aspiring meteorologists Some wanted to be "theoreticians" -- scientists that study the serious math and physics of the science A lot of these folks usually went on to develop the computer models that would simulate the behavior of the atmosphere Others wanted to become "synopticians" -- meteorologists who would use the computer models in the real world to skillfully predict the day to day weather There was always a rivalry between the two camps The scientists seemed a little jealous of the forecasters as forecasters would get all the glory from the scientists hard work The forecasters didn t get along with the scientists because the scientists were for lack of a better term the nerds the geeks on campus Well here it is 40 years later and it s time to give the geeks their due Because the world of computer models has come along way thanks to the theoreticians A prime example of this would be Hurricane Sandy Back in the 1980s forecasting the development track and intensity of a developing hurricane was risky business if you tried to make that forecast for more than three days in the future But thanks to bigger and faster computers - most especially more accurate computer models - both National Weather Service and broadcast meteorologists were able to do some amazing things with Sandy s forecast We were able to predict Sandy s birth down in the south-central Caribbean Sea about a week before it was designated a tropical depression And there were computer models that nailed the forecast of Sandy s head-on hit of the northeast United States five and six days in advance So score one for who we once considered the weather geeks The computer modeling that they ve done played a key role in saving many lives over the past few days And though they are neither geeks egg-heads and nerds (most of them anyway) - our hats are off to the fine folks at the National Hurricane Center who made some great forecasts with those computer models

------------------------------------------------------------
With Wayne Rooney ruled out through injury and Danny Welbeck consigned to his sick bed Hernandez was handed striking responsibilities It looked like being a frustrating afternoon for the Mexican who failed to convert two clear chances to give United a priceless victory However his luck changed in the final minute when he beat the Newcastle offside trap to reach Michael Carrick s cross and seal a dramatic 4-3 win with his 10th goal of the season Now into his third season at Old Trafford the 24-year-old has rediscovered the form that earned him a Champions League starting berth and 20 goals in his first However Robin van Persie s arrival means those coveted spots in Sir Alex Ferguson s team are harder to come by "Ask any player in the world and they will tell you they want to play every game " Hernandez said "But the competition here is incredible It is the biggest club in the world You need to be aware there are five strikers who want to be part of the games "I have to prove in one minute or 90 that I want to start " Hernandez accepts he will never enjoy the perfect game hence his refusal to let a couple of misses play mental havoc before he scored the goal that sent United seven points clear in the title race "I didn t have those things in my mind " he said "You cannot afford to regret every chance you miss because if you do you will never be concentrated for the next opportunity "You are never going to play the perfect game You will never score five goals from five opportunities "That is the beauty of football The most important thing was the win because here there are no heroes "It doesn t matter if I score in the last minute or we score four goals We won and Manchester City lost That is very good news "

Mo-Farah-Clare-Balding-Lisa-Riley-Thomas-Heatherwick-What-we-learnt-in-2012.html lost: My New Year s resolutions are to keep working hard become a better athlete and learn another language maybe French or Spanish
------------------------------------------------------------
At the start of the year I had goals and targets Now I have golds and memories 2012 has been even better than I could have dreamt The Olympics were perfect for me and then to have that topped off with the birth of my twin daughters I feel very blessed If you keep working hard the rewards will come It s this attitude I will keep with me as I move on to face new challenges From the athletics point of view maybe crossing the line in the 5 000m to complete the double just edges the 10 000m but there is very little in it How can I put that ahead of seeing my beautiful baby girls born All very happy times I ve had to adapt my life since the Olympics as I m in the public eye now but I hope that the people who knew me before still think of me as the same guy Sue MacGregor Writer and broadcaster (Clara Molden) I ll look back on 2012 as the year I found my Uncle Iain Not him in person but his grave in a peaceful military cemetery on the remote island of Ambon in Indonesia He was in the RAF and died in 1943 as a prisoner of the Japanese in dreadful conditions I managed to get to Ambon and put an English rose and a flaming red hibiscus on his grave My only regret is that my mother his sister never knew where he d ended up The experience taught me how strong the emotional connection can be with someone you ve never met How have I changed Not enough I fear I am still terribly impatient But the bad news is that as you get older your faults apparently magnify John Whaite Winner of The Great British Bake Off 2012 (PA) It s been the best year of my life Not only did I finish my law degree which of course made my parents really proud but I also won the third series of The Great British Bake Off I ve learnt that I m impatient and I can be erratic and impulsive This year though has taught me the importance of letting things unfold naturally rather than trying to force them My favourite day was when I won the Bake Off I wasn t sure whether or not I should tell my grandparents about winning but I spoke to my grandad who was elated The next day he suffered a brain haemorrhage and I never got to speak to him again so I m happy that I made him proud that day In January I m going to Le Cordon Bleu in London to study for my Patisserie Diploma so my resolution is to learn as much as I possibly can and to enjoy every minute of it Thomas Heatherwick Designer (Andrew Crowley) On July 27 2012 the moment arrived when the seven young athletes took their flames and reached forward to light my studio s cauldron in the Olympic stadium After two years of planning I took a deep breath and tried to go into a state of relaxation knowing there was nothing more I could do As the last of the 204 flames was lit you could feel the bemusement of spectators at what appeared to be a flat cauldron sitting on the ground But then there was the huge sense of relief when the copper pieces started to lift That was the moment when the 80 000 people in the stadium gasped and I felt the sound rush through me in a way that I will never forget William Chubb Actor (Andrew Crowley) At about 1 30am on May 29 2012 my wife Cassandra Jardine The Daily Telegraph feature writer and mother of our five children died in her sleep aged 57 She had spent the previous two years in a valiant struggle against lung cancer For my children and me 2012 has been life-changing I learnt that we should cherish and care for those we love because really they re all we ve got The support of friends and Cass s colleagues following her death and my children s wonderful contributions to their mother s memorial service at St Bride s will always stay in my memory Over the year I have become less ambitious considerably older perhaps more cautious perhaps more chilled (not difficult) My New Year s resolution is to do as Cass would have done enjoy life Rachel Onasanwo The happiest Olympic worker 2012 was the year I discovered that people find me as funny as I find myself Not only did I have one of the most fun jobs I ve ever had working at the Olympics I got rewarded for doing that job with what I will call fame People I didn t know knew my name and they wanted to take their picture with me all because of a video someone took of me just being me I was entertaining the crowds that day but I had no idea so many people would share my sentiments I ve learnt that being yourself is the best you can be I loved every minute of the Olympics It was the friendliest I have ever seen London and I can t wait to have children so I can tell them about it and then tell their children about it too Glenda Cooper Journalist (Paul Grover) This is the year in which I grew up This might seem an odd thing to say as a mother of two with a mortgage and a 15-year career But when your 44-year-old husband comes home one day and says he s got a rare potentially incurable cancer you suddenly realise that this is the moment when you can t run away I learnt that living with cancer isn t always dramatic it s often terribly mundane Dom and I ate Haribo and drank cheap wine the night he was diagnosed The days before his regular scans we usually argue about who s loading the dishwasher to distract ourselves When Dom wrote about having cancer for this paper s Weekend section I wondered how people would react In fact Twitter went absolutely mad; a million people saw the article the first day alone Lots of people asked what they could do to help including the novelist Alexander Masters and Liz Scarff a social media consultant They met with Dom and the crowdfunding website iCancer (icancer org uk) was set up in just three weeks I was so proud of them for taking a sad thing and changing it into something positive I plan to raise a lot of glasses on New Year s Eve to slam the door on 2012 and look forward to the future to see how much money we can raise for iCancer to fund research into a cure Catherine and Gareth Bull Won 40 6 million on the EuroMillions jackpot on January 20 2012 (PA) 2012 was one long roller coaster More than anything we have learnt to take our time and be patient We are only young [Catherine is 35 and Gareth is 41] and don t want to waste this opportunity so we consider everything carefully before we decide to do something or buy something It is a great feeling to know you have helped out your parents and family and their reactions have been special Initially we allowed ourselves to splurge we bought a brand new car and a box at Old Trafford We don t think we have changed our family and friends are still the same For us winning EuroMillions just changed our circumstances We are lucky not to have any money worries and we love our life so our plan for next year would be to continue as we are now being happy and healthy Chris Robshaw England rugby captain (AP) Winning the Aviva premiership with Harlequins and becoming England captain are two moments that have made 2012 remarkable for me I have spent my whole career with Harlequins so captaining their first premiership win was one of the most gratifying experiences of my career Singing God Save the Queen in my first home game as England captain was also a moving experience that I ll never forget As captain you have to make decisions for your team in the heat of the moment I have learnt that you have to take responsibility for those decisions whether they turn out in your favour or not During the Autumn Internationals many people wrote off our chances of winning against New Zealand after losing to Australia and South Africa However I never doubted we had the ability to beat New Zealand who many people regard as the greatest team at the moment (On December 1 England beat New Zealand 38-21 ) Next year I want to read more and stay off the pick n mix! Nick D Aloisio App designer aged 17 This year I ve been lucky enough to see something that I started as a hobby in my bedroom being used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide While building Summly my mobile app for browsing news articles it has been my privilege to meet some of the world s most experienced business men and women All of them told me to stay focused and not get ahead of myself The reaction to the app has been tremendous but it s the first step in what I hope will be a long career My education is still very important to me and I want to make sure I finish all my studies in 2013 I m pretty sure I ll always look back on 2012 and think of it as the year everything changed for me Bryony Gordon Journalist (Christopher Pledger) This year I have covered an Olympics reported on a Diamond Jubilee and become a homeowner As an aside I also found out I was pregnant I have been invited to Buckingham Palace stood in the middle of the velodrome as Sir Chris Hoy won gold and carried the Olympic torch If I never have as momentous a year as this I will not complain I have a feeling that from now on I will need to conserve my energy for the little bundle I am expecting to arrive in 2013 Frank Cottrell Boyce Children s writer and collaborator on Danny Boyle s Olympics opening ceremony I will look back on 2012 as the year we surprised the world and amazed ourselves It was also the year I finally cleared out our shed A favourite moment was catching the Tube at Bromley-by-Bow one evening a few months before the opening ceremony: it suddenly filled up with volunteers all races classes ages abilities all clutching their bottles of water all singing and I thought this is what a nation is Britain is a project After the ceremony my daughter said: It feels like my daddy did all that just for me That was pretty good After meeting engineers technicians and choreographers at a rehearsal for the opening ceremony my son said: I hadn t realised there were so many different ways to be brilliant That stuck with me too Clare Balding Television presenter (Julian Andrews) Working on the Olympics and Paralympics in London 2012 was the highlight of my broadcasting career I loved every second Then my book My Animals and Other Family was published and went straight to number one which was incredible 2012 has been busy exhilarating and unforgettable I learnt that I can survive on less sleep than I previously thought and my New Year s resolutions are to keep challenging myself as a broadcaster and do my best to promote women s sport as I think it can change the world Lisa Riley Actress Strictly Come Dancing contestant 2012 (BBC) It has been an emotional year in every possible way I lost my amazing mum who was my best friend and I miss her every single day I believe that she sent me Strictly Come Dancing during which I have had the best time of my entire career I know mum is looking down on me and would be so proud of what I achieved on the programme I have learnt that people should never judge a book by its cover that I have a voice and I am entitled to use it And it does not matter what size or shape you are you can be who you want to be I hope I can give up smoking in the new year I have done it before for three and a half months but the stress of doing the Strictly tour might change that

Because it offers a unique blend of musical sophistication and emotional light and shade is the usual reply Which is true but there are classical pieces which get their power the same way as many pop songs ie obsessing away at one thing with blinding clarity And yet because of the huge sophistication of the language the flavour is immensely subtle as well as strong This harpsichord sonata by the Italian composer Domenico Scarlatti is one such piece Scarlatti was born in the same miraculous year of 1685 as Bach and Handel though he couldn t be more different They were Protestant North Germans by birth both sophisticated masters of many different forms able to mingle German French and Italian influences into their music Whereas Scarlatti is Mediterranean through and through His music is full of blazing sun and violent black shadows He s famous for composing harpsichord sonatas hundreds of them nearly all in the same simple two-part form where each half is repeated (if you can t stand the sound of the harpsichord don t worry plenty of pianists have recorded Scarlatti s sonatas) Scarlatti was a virtuoso harpsichordist at a time when being a virtuoso really mattered There s a nice story about Scarlatti seeing a rival amaze an audience at the harpsichord in Venice It was carnival time so the player was wearing a mask Either that s the devil playing said Scarlatti or the famous Saxon (meaning Handel) It was Handel but Scarlatti came within an ace of beating Handel in a harpsichord competition so he must have been devilishly good himself His sonatas are certainly devilish to play They re full of hammered chords and hugely difficult hand-crossings where one hand holds a busy pattern in the middle of the keyboard while the other leaps from top to bottom and back again (Bach was impressed by this and it rubbed off on his own music in pieces like the Goldberg Variations) It was a strange career move on Scarlatti s part to focus so obsessively on the private medium of sonatas rather than moneymaking genres like opera It happened because fate plucked him out of his native Italy and put him down in a completely different culture In 1719 he took on the job of musical director at the Royal Chapel in Lisbon One of his royal pupils was the Princess Maria Barbara and when she married the Spanish Prince Ferdinando Scarlatti moved with her to the Spanish court There he stayed until his death in 1757 writing among many other things hundreds of sonatas to amuse his royal pupil who must have been a mean keyboard player herself They have a unique sharp spicy flavour utterly different from the norm of late Baroque keyboard music represented by composers like Telemann or Handel (Bach was unusual in a different way) Their works have a Frenchified stateliness with neat dance forms following one another in set patterns Whereas Scarlatti s sonatas are like snapshots of a particular scene or genre There are brusque dances sweet little pastorales marches and weird angular laments Running through all of them are unmistakable signs of the delighted shock Scarlatti must have felt on arriving in the foreign musical culture of Iberia and hearing its folk music You can hear the strumming of guitars in his sonatas with their odd wrong note open strings pushing against the academically correct notes sounded at the same time It sounds startlingly modern and it makes Scarlatti seem our contemporary in a way Bach and Handel never do But Scarlatti didn t go native We shouldn t think of him as an 18th-century Gauguin wearing the clothes of the Spanish muleteers whose songs he noted down He was a famously cultured and urbane character and what gives his music its special flavour is the way 18th-century courtliness and wild strumming folky energy sit side-by-side LISTENING POINTS 00 00 The speed and constant Ta-tata-ta-ta rhythm suggests a march but the feeling is too hectic and driven and fierce to be martial 00 10 a running bass makes the music scamper off in a new direction but then it seems to get obsessed with one harmonic area and hammers away at until the first part of the sonata ends before repeating itself This contrast between breakneck motion and obsessive emphasis on one or two chords is very typical of Scarlatti 1 32 The sonata moves on to its second half This is even odder than the first half with some very scrunchy chords and a surprise minor harmony at 1 44 where we expect major (alongside some perfectly normal Baroque progressions which is what makes these oddities so very odd) 1 52 The music seems to get stuck again just as it did in the first half until finally it tears itself free and comes to a close at 2 16 Then we hear the whole of the second half again There s a strange quality in those moments of fixity almost like desperation It might remind us of a much later form of Latin passion the tango where intensity can also seem close to despair FURTHER LISTENING 1 If you can t stand that harpsichord clatter try the piano version of the same sonata given a less furious more delicate quality by Andras Schiff ________________________________________________ 2 You could spend a whole year exploring Scarlatti s 500-odd sonatas The Sonata in C minor K56 is astounding for its physicality Just listen to the way Hantai s right hand jumps over the left at 00 29 hitting the right note every time ________________________________________________ 3 Scarlatti wasn t always fierce as the lovely Pastorale K380 shows It s beautifully played here by Mikhail Pletnev ________________________________________________ 4 Scarlatti could also strike a plaintively sad slow note In his B minor sonata K87 the pathos comes from the way the music finds its way to a painfully intense harmonic region and then obsesses at it So under the surface it s not so different from his fast pieces ________________________________________________

Wind power deadline sees US firms rush to build turbines US energy companies are racing to install wind turbines before a federal tax credit expires at the end of this year Experts say that wind power has exceeded the construction of natural gas plants in recent months However the financial incentive for wind could be lost as congress struggles to avoid financial deadlock Even if the credit is extended it is expected that new installations will decline in 2013 According to industry analysts the federal government s production tax credit has played an important role in the expansion of wind energy across the US since it was first introduced in 1992 Wind passes gas At that point there was less than 1 5 gigawatts of power generating capacity provided by wind across the country That figure has grown dramatically This year has seen around 12 gigawatts of wind power capacity installed outpacing even natural gas projects which have boomed on the back of cheap shale The government subsidy works out at 2 2 cents per kilowatt hour of power produced over ten years This amounts to around $1m ( 620 000) for every large turbine However the deadline is absolute - to get the money the blades on new installations must be turning and generating power before the 31st of December "There s a lot of rushing right now to get projects completed by the end of the year " says Rob Gramlich senior vice president at the American Wind Energy Association "It is not a great way to run a business with this policy-induced uncertainty " The tax credit has proved contentious with some lawmakers criticising it as too generous It lapsed previously in 1999 2001 and 2003 Each time it lead to a collapse in new construction The American Wind Energy Association are hoping the tax credit will be passed as part of a compromise package of legislation to help the US avoid the so-called fiscal cliff The say the most likely outcome is a short term extension of the subsidy "There s a good chance we could get this extension it is very hard to predict but the industry is not making bets on the Congress getting it done " says Mr Gramlich Even if there is an extension there is likely to be a significant curtailment of wind installations in 2013 Wind energy companies say they need longer time frames to negotiate deals to sell the power they generate Iberdrola Renewables is the second largest developer of wind power projects in the United States The company is racing to finalise new wind installations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire However the prospects for new turbines in 2013 are slim according to Paul Copleman communications manager for Iberdrola "Even if the tax credit is extended our new construction plans likely will be ramped back substantially in 2013 compared with the last few years So much time has passed without certainty that a normal one-year extension would not be a game-changer for our 2013 build plans " Some analysts argue that all subsidies to wind should end and the industry should stand on its own two feet They say that the current arrangements mean that energy companies continue to make money even when there is a surplus of wind and the market price is negative Dan Kish is with the Institute for Energy Research a body long critical of subsidies for renewables He told BBC News the extension of the tax credit was expensive unnecessary and destabilising to the electricity grid "Wind produces power at a fraction of its stated capacity and is increasingly adding unnecessary costs to consumers just as it is in the UK " he said "They are creations of government and serve only to make their builders and owners wealthy at the expense of the public " Follow Matt on Twitter

------------------------------------------------------------
Tax campaigners say the trend is the clearest signal yet that tax avoidance has blossomed under a more business-friendly strategy at the UK tax authority Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) That was down 5bn or 21pc since 2000/01 when the government then controlled by the Labour Party took the first steps towards a more collaborative approach to big business At the same time the gross operating surplus for all companies in the UK - a widely watched measure of companies profitability compiled by the Office of National Statistics - has risen 65pc to 329bn The economy has grown by 55pc over the same period and receipts of both personal income tax and small companies income tax are higher HMRC and the finance ministry denied the figures showed an increase in tax avoidance - legal tactics used by multinationals such as Google Amazon and Starbucks They cited recent economic weakness and lower corporation tax rates The UK s official corporation tax rate was steady at 30pc between 2000 and 2007 but has been gradually cut In the last tax year it was 26pc Reuters calculations show the lower tax rate and the weak economy account for about half the fall leaving around 2 6bn of the difference in the amount of corporate tax paid between 2000/01 and 2011/12 unaccounted for John Christensen of Tax Justice Network a tax campaigning group said the figures show successive governments attempts to create a more business-friendly administration - which includes a policy known as "enhanced relationship" based on mutual trust - have encouraged companies to use such tactics "These figures tell a more powerful story than any figures I have seen so far " he said adding that senior HMRC staff had told him in recent years that they were "alarmed" at the drop in payments from large companies HMRC defines these as firms with annual profit of more than 1 5m The finance ministry declined to comment on the calculations Prem Sikka a professor of accounting at Essex University who has written extensively about tax avoidance said that even allowing for the tax cut the figures were "paradoxical" "How are they managing to reconcile higher profits with lower taxes " he said "It can t be done unless they are booking these profits somewhere else " Companies reporting for tax purposes are increasingly diverting UK profits to lower-tax jurisdictions he said Google for example channels $4bn of UK sales through Ireland each year most of which ends up in Bermuda Google said it complies with tax law in every country in which it operates but that it also has an obligation to its shareholders "to run our business efficiently" When shown the calculations an HMRC spokesman said the downward trend may also have been emphasised by a shift in the way taxes were paid from 1999 which led to "elements of double counting" in 2000/01 and 2001/02 That could make revenues in those years look artificially high He declined to quantify the impact of this Sikka dismissed the impact of this change "That wouldn t make any difference to the total tax liability " he said HMRC s own data does not point to a spike in corporation tax payments over the period the changes were initiated Total corporation tax payments were just 2bn higher in 2001-2002 than in 1998-1999 a rise of 7pc while GDP rose 16pc over the period The government s tax minister David Gauke who has described corporation tax as one of "the most economically damaging taxes" called the tax authority s current approach "very successful" in a September speech He declined requests for an interview Source: Reuters

Prescription medicine waste costs 500 000 to NHS in Scotland The Liberal Democrats have hit out at the 500 000 a year cost to the NHS in Scotland for collecting and destroying unused prescriptions The figures obtained by freedom of information cover the cost of medicines returned unused to pharmacies in 10 out of 14 health boards in 2011/12 The Scottish Lib Dems said colossal amounts of medicines were being wasted The Scottish government said GPs health boards and patients needed to be aware of the problem The collective cost for the 10 health boards totalled 517 342 In Glasgow the cost was 120 000 while in Lothian 46 239 was spent in 2011/12 with 44 tonnes collected in 2011 Elsewhere Grampian spent 70 638 collecting 36 4 tonnes of wastage in 2011 while Fife spent around 33 000 annually collecting approximately 19 tonnes Lib Dem health spokesman Jim Hume said these costs did not take into account the value of the medicines being wasted or the cost of prescribing them in the first place He said many people were also throwing out unused prescriptions rather than returning them to the pharmacy Mr Hume added: "NHS staff need to regularly review the medicines that a patient is on This is a proactive measure which could cut costs and improve health by ensuring patients are receiving appropriate treatment "Patients can do their part by ensuring that they don t take out repeat prescriptions and then not use them "This means visiting your GP if you re unsure about the need for your repeat prescription With taxpayers footing the bill we should do what we can to reduce it " A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "Reducing medicine waste is something everyone needs to be involved with which is why health boards are working through local campaigns GPs and pharmacies to make sure patients understand how and when to take their prescription "Reducing medicine waste not only saves the NHS money - it can also mean that patient conditions are better managed and can reduce hospital admissions "

What s so special about September 10 By Hurricane Expert Jim Reif Two noteworthy events are worth mentioning when we reach September 10 th on the calendar First today is the absolute peak of the 6 month hurricane season Statistically speaking we see more hurricanes and tropical storms in the Atlantic at this point on the calendar than any other time of the year The peak is also considered the statistical half-way point in an average hurricane season Fortunately each hurricane season is not statistically aligned I d hate to think that we have another 13 named storms to go by the end of the year If we did we d be looking for storm names in the Greek alphabet like we did in 2005 September 10 th also has a special meaning for SW Floridians It was this morning back in 1960 some 52 years ago that a Category 3 hurricane by the name of Donna came directly up the Collier coastline to make landfall on the southern end of Fort Myers Beach Donna s damage on the SW peninsula was measured in the tens of millions of dollars which doesn t sound like much But back then there were only 10 000 people on all of Collier county and barely 50 000 people in Lee Experts say that a similar storm hitting SW Florida today could cause more than $20 billion of damage Fortunately no such storm is out in the Atlantic today We are still tracking Tropical Storm Leslie and Hurricane Michael in the North Atlantic A developing storm in the distant East Atlantic may take the name Nadine in the next day or two But none of these are a threat to SW Florida

Obama names Hagel and Brennan to lead Pentagon and CIA US President Barack Obama has named Chuck Hagel to be his next defence secretary and counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan to lead the CIA but the nominations may not go smoothly Former Nebraska Senator Hagel s fellow Republicans have accused him of being hostile to Israel and soft on Iran Mr Brennan is also under scrutiny over harsh interrogation techniques used at the CIA Both appointments must be confirmed by the Senate Mr Obama who has just returned from a family holiday in Hawaii said at a White House press conference that Mr Hagel was "the leader our troops deserve" Worst possible message Mr Obama said that Mr Hagel 66 has been a "champion of our troops" as he praised his independence and bipartisan approach The president said Mr Hagel knew that American leadership was "indispensable" but added that he would treat military action as a last resort Mr Obama said: "Most importantly Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction " Mr Hagel a decorated Vietnam War veteran would be the first enlisted soldier to lead the Pentagon In his remarks Mr Hagel said he would try to "live up to the standards" of his predecessors as he pledged to strengthen America s alliances Departing Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said he strongly supported Mr Hagel s nomination "I believe his experience his judgment and his deep understanding of the security issues facing this country make him the right choice to be the next secretary of defense " Mr Panetta said in a statement Meanwhile Mr Brennan said he would work to ensure that the CIA "always reflects the liberties freedoms and values that we hold so dear" Along with Senator John Kerry whom Mr Obama nominated last month to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state Mr Hagel and Mr Brennan would help shape the president s second-term national security agenda Continue reading the main story Chuck Hagel in his own words On Iran sanctions: Isolating nations is

of the horrific results of a nuclear war and the consequences they would suffer On the United Nations: [The] only international organization that can help bring the consensus that is indispensable in finding solutions and resolving crises On the Pentagon: Bloated budgets and lack of effective oversight and review are symptoms of deeper structural inadequacy in our military posture From Chuck Hagel s 2008 book America: Our Next Chapter But the choice of Mr Hagel could prompt a Senate confirmation battle Mr Hagel has stoked controversy in criticising a military strike by either the US or Israel against Iran He has also advocated including Iran on future peace talks in Afghanistan Although no Republican lawmakers are threatening to block Mr Hagel s nomination influential senators have attacked him Senator John McCain said he had "serious concerns" over the Nebraskan s positions on a "range of critical national security issues" which he would raise during the Senate confirmation process Mr Hagel made critical remarks against the Israel lobby in the US capital in a 2008 book by former state department official Aaron David Miller "The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here " Mr Hagel was quoted as saying "I m a United States senator I m not an Israeli senator " Top Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN on Sunday: "This is an in-your-face nomination of the president to all of us who are supportive of Israel " Homophobic comment But White House officials say Mr Hagel s positions on these issues have been misrepresented saying he voted to send billions in military assistance to Israel and has supported the imposition of multilateral sanctions on Tehran In an interview with his hometown newspaper on Monday the Lincoln Journal Star Mr Hagel said his record showed "unequivocal total support" for Israel and that his critics had "completely distorted" his record Mr Hagel has also been criticised by some Democrats for saying in 1998 that a nominee for an ambassador post was "openly aggressively gay" He has since apologised for those comments President Obama s decision to nominate John Brennan to lead the Central Intelligence Agency is also not without controversy Although put forward for the same role in 2008 Mr Brennan withdrew his name amid questions about his connection as a top CIA official to interrogation techniques used during the administration of George W Bush Sen McCain said in a statement on Monday he had questions for Mr Brennan "especially what role he played in the so-called enhanced interrogation programs as well as his public defense of those programs" A CIA veteran Mr Brennan is currently Mr Obama s chief counter-terrorism adviser The 57-year-old was heavily involved in the planning of the 2011 raid that killed Osama Bin Laden He would replace Gen David Petraeus who resigned in November after admitting to an affair with his biographer In a memo to staff acting CIA director Michael Morell called Mr Brennan an "outstanding choice" citing his two decades of experience at the agency
