------------------------------------------------------------
Another political murder in Lebanon another dashed hope for peace Early yesterday morning in the latest of a series of attacks against political leaders in Lebanon that began with the February 2005 murder of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri a car bomb killed Fran ois al-Hajj a brigadier general in Lebanon s army and his bodyguard Hajj had been expected to take over as the army s commanding officer from General Michel Suleiman who is poised many Lebanese believe to soon become their country s next president Now though reports France 24 "Several experts fear that the attack against Hajj will jeopardize the Dec[ember] 17 presidential vote Following internecine squabbles between pro- and anti-Syrian political parties the vote has been delayed eight times leaving Lebanon without a president since mile Lahoud stepped down" as head of state on November 24 Now with Hajj dead and no obvious successor for the army-chief s role waiting in the wings that top military post could remain vacant if Lebanon s parliament elects Suleiman president next Monday France 24 notes that although "no group has taken responsibility for [yesterday s] attack suspicions in some sections of Lebanese society have once more focused on Syria Damascus has been blamed for a series of deadly attacks against anti-Syrian Lebanese politicians including Hariri Syria has consistently denied involvement in the killings " However a former Lebanese finance minister told the French news service that he does not believe "Syria could benefit from the death of a general [who was] central to the reconstruction of Lebanon " He said: "It s not in its interest to eliminate those who value the political independence of the army " According to the Lebanese army the bomb that destroyed Hajj s automobile contained 35 kilos (roughly 77 pounds) of TNT and had been "placed inside a 30-year-old olive-green BMW that was parked along the side of the road The device appear[ed] to have been triggered remotely The blast created a 2-meter-wide [6 5-foot-wide] crater and resulted in serious damage to surrounding buildings " (Daily Star) An editorial in Lebanon s French-language daily L Orient le Jour today notes that the "implacable death machine" that has killed so many Lebanese political figures appears determined to continue acting with "insolent impunity" despite international condemnation and that it is determined to quash "the aspirations of an entire people" that seeks to live in peace under an efficiently functioning democratic government An editorial in the Beirut-based Daily Star points out that yesterday s assassination of Hajj "strikes at the last remaining symbol of unity in this country the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) For years the military has been more successful than other institutions in limiting and even reversing the corrosive effects of sectarianism so any attack on it is also an assault on national spirit and a blow to progressive policies [T]he murder of Hajj figures to complicate the challenges facing the LAF s commander General Michel Suleiman whether or not he eventually emerges as the country s next president " The paper s editorial adds alluding to Lebanon s pro-Syrian and anti-Syrian camps adds: "Each of the multiple shocks that have rocked Lebanon over the past year or so has fueled talk of a precipice on whose edge the country can only teeter for so long before it tumbles over into chaos Conversely some of the more dangerous incidents have been touted as potential catalysts for a widespread realization of the need for an end to the impasse If some form of discipline can be maintained among the ranks of both camps this might be the occasion that convinces both of them of the urgent need for them to settle their differences " Posted By: Edward M Gomez (Email) |

The Face of Business to learn how the latest virtualization techniques and technologies can make your company and your data center more successful Click here EMC Sees Virtualization in SMBs Storage Future January 8 2008By Dan Muse Storage demands and the need to effectively manage all that data are growing faster than you can say terabytes And a server isn t simply a physical box anymore thanks to virtualization technology Noting storage networks and virtual servers need to work together EMC Corp today introduced a SAN array designed for small and medium businesses looking for a scalable storage capacity along with integration with VMware virtualization technology the theory being that even if you re not packing terabytes and flirting with virtual machines today you will be soon The AX4 which will also be sold by Dell as the Dell AX4-5 can scale to 60 TBs and supports either iSCSI or Fibre Channel SAN connectivity For the majority of SMBs it will be the iSCSI option that s most attractive According to EMC the SAN system can store manage and protect data from up to 64 high availability Windows Linux Unix NetWare and VMware Infrastructure hosts simultaneously According to EMC the AX4 will eventually replace the AX150 in the Clariion line "This is third generation in this line and we haven t changed anything with the simplicity of the storage " said Phil Treide marketing manager for EMC Clariion "We expect lots of first-time network storage users " You also have the choice of either iSCSI or Fibre Channel and you can mix and types of drives to create tiered storage i e SAS for high performance or SATA for higher capacity and lower price With a list price of $8 599 for its Entry Level Configuration the Clariion AX4 system isn t for every small business but it is designed to give SMBs with hefty storage requirements plenty of room to grow Treide said the AX4 features "lots of expandability It s all about scalability Previously it was 12 drives but now it scales to 60 drives " The Entry Level price includes 3TB of capacity support for up to 10 hosts and Navisphere Express Management Software The management software is wizard-based and lets you "provision storage with six or seven clicks " Treide said You expand disk pools in the background he said The software is designed to expand capacity quickly with Clariion MetaLUNs and migrate data with the SAN via EMC s Virtual LUNs It also includes integrated snapshots for backup capabilities "Snapshots are standard and that s not typical in this price class " The AX4 also supports path management and failover capabilities The Advanced Configuration scales to 60 TB and supports up to 64 hosts which Treide said is important as "we move to virtual hosts " The Clariion AX4 was specifically designed for SMBs according to EMC and is built on the same architecture used in larger Clariion CX3 midrange storage arrays which offer "Five 9s" availability or 99 999 percent of uptime Treide said the "Web-based management tools are designed for storage generalists rather than storage specialists " The Clariion AX4 also features a mirrored cache design built-in standby power supply continuous disk consistency checking and hot-swappable components to help ensure the availability and reliability of your data Let s Get Virtual The Clariion AX4 system was specifically designed to integrate with VMware Infrastructure capabilities many of which require shared storage Built-in features are aimed at making it easier to allocate high-performance storage for new virtual machines The Clariion AX4 also includes EMC s Virtual LUN technology which can be used in conjunction with VMware Storage VMotion a new product introduced as part of the most recent version of VMware Infrastructure for the non-disruptive migration of multiple virtual machine disk files In addition the Clariion AX4 supports EMC s leading replication software including EMC MirrorView EMC SAN Copy EMC RepliStor and EMC Replication Manager to provide the highest levels of uptime in VMware environments VWware may be not standard fare yet in small businesses but "it is relevant for certain kinds of data-intensive small businesses" Charles King principal analyst at Pund-IT said "We re not seeing of VMware in production environments for businesses with fewer than 20-30 servers But for SMBs that moving to virtual servers the AX4 s capabilities will be welcomed King said "Effectively backing up virtual servers is a technically intensive process There aren t a lot of storage arrays supporting it It s not something I ve seen from anyone else " It s makes sense for EMC to leverage VMware technology King said "VMware allows them to be a systems vendor without selling servers EMC definitely has ambitions well beyond the enterprise data center " However King pointed out that both VMware and EMC will continue to work with vendors "VMware is agnostic and that s one of the keys to virtualization VMware has certainly been open to working with anyone who has a good idea " EMC also isn t going to put all its eggs in one virtual basket "Microsoft is a major partner of EMC and you can expect them to continue to work together enthusiastically " said King EMC s Treide confirmed that in the future the AX4 will also integrate with XenSource virtualization and Microsoft s HyperV when it ships sometime in 2008 "It s going to be an interesting year for virtualization " King said "I thought 2007 was interesting but 2008 is going to be every bit as interesting " For Whom the Dell Tolls Since 2001 Dell has partnered with EMC for storage networking The companies renewed their vows in 2006 extending the partnership to 2011 However the relationship could change now based on Dell s November 2007 $1 4 billion purchase of iSCSI vendor EqualLogic For now though Dell and EMC seem as friendly as ever "We ve had tremendous success with Dell EMC s Treide said "and we plan to continue " Dell seems to agree: "This is the latest step in the strong partnership between Dell and EMC " said Darren Thomas vice president and general manager Dell storage in a statement released this morning

Print this Business Times Margaret Harris 06 January 2008 Corporate social networking allows companies to benefit from the immediacy of it As the social networking bandwagon gains pace IT departments are trying to determine whether Internet-based solutions such as Facebook and MySpace are security risks to be managed or an inevitability to be accepted Research company Gartner says there is no guarantee that deployment of a corporate social networking solution will be successful even if there is already a solid base of employees using sites such as Facebook It adds however that corporate social networking solutions are generally good products and offer some security advantages over Internet-based social networking sites Ultimately the value of social networking resides in content and not the product Nikos Drakos an analyst at Gartner says the advantage of a social networking solution over the standard company intranet is that the former is controlled by the enduser Intranets have become centralised and are controlled by management Social software platforms however have the individual as the starting point Intranets are used to post policy statements and updates; they are about communicating with the users and users cannot respond Social networking sites however allow for the free flow of information which can have important spin-offs for the company Groups of people separated geographically can be united via the platform and work on a project together Innovation for example often relies on the chance combination of otherwise unrelated ideas A team of engineers working in Cape Town can communicate with another team in Durban to solve a problem What s more says Drakos all the communication between the teams will be available to others Chats over the coffee machine may hold great promise but they cannot be kept and filed like conversations on the social networking site However the system does raise privacy issues but its transparency can also be its protection If users know that everything will be available to everyone in the company they will need to be careful about how they use it To get the most out of the system e-mail patterns also need to be analysed Drakos says If you look at e-mail patterns you can visualise the way in which people communicate; who has been talking to whom With this map of communication you can see where to go to find information about a particular client supplier or product This map can be further enhanced by adding information about what users have bookmarked on the web but can the information be trusted With an open and transparent platform you do need to be concerned about the quality of information and the abuse of the platform though there are practical ways to deal with these issues Drakos recommends a staggered introduction beginning with groups where trust exists and then slowing spreading it Policies will be there to guide usage but companies must also develop social norms of what is acceptable It must evolve slowly with participation from management and staff Not all companies have leapt at the opportunity to launch a corporate social network Some are keener than others says Drakos adding that it is often the IT departments that are most sceptical They want to know about the architecture standards tools and viability whereas the CEO is eager to reap the benefits he says Companies responses to sites such as Facebook have been varied and some have chosen to ban staff from accessing the sites Corporate social networking on the other hand allows companies to benefit from the immediacy of it where employees use it for work rather than social purposes But it needs to be handled with care Comments

Harbhajan has been defended by his captain India have withdrawn their threat to quit the tour of Australia if an appeal against Harbhajan Singh s ban fails The spinner was suspended for three games for allegedly making a racist comment to Australian Andrew Symonds in the second Test in Sydney Harbhajan has denied making the comment and the appeal is due to take place before the third Test on 16 January "There s no question of it being called off " India cricket board president Sharad Pawar was quoted as saying BCCI board spokesman Rajiv Shukla quoted Pawar and said: "He (Pawar) said the two boards intend to maintain good relations as there is no problem with the two " India suspended their tour on Monday after Harbhajan was banned for three Tests following a hearing into the incident The tourists were outraged that Harbhajan was punished claiming the spinner did not racially abuse Symonds and that the verdict was based on hearsay In a statement issued after the decision the Board of Control for Cricket in India called the ban "totally uncalled for unjustified and patently illegal" and said it would "take all possible steps to get the player cleared of the obnoxious and baseless accusation" 606: DEBATE India were also incensed by several controversial umpiring decisions especially by Steve Bucknor during a tempestuous second Test which Australia won in dramatic style But Bucknor has been replaced by Billy Bowden for the next Test in Perth India captain Anil Kumble also accused Australia of gamesmanship during the second Test India also put in a complaint over comments made by Australian spinner Brad Hogg to Kumble and Mahendra Dhoni as the two nations became embroiled in an unsavoury row But there seems to be an uneasy peace between the two camps at present ahead of the start of the third Test

After Bhutto: The world will long remember Benazir Bhutto as a modern Muslim woman who served two terms as Pakistan s first woman prime minister: bright attractive articulate talented courageous charismatic an astute politician and political leader who called for a secular democratic Pakistan Benazir was all of these but -- like her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and a number of other Pakistani political leaders -- she also left a flawed political track record that both reflected and contributed to many of Pakistan s problems Bhutto was an avowed reformer who in two terms as prime minister failed to bring major political or social change; a leader who did little for the overwhelming number of poor Pakistanis who live in a feudal society; a celebrated feminist who despite promises as prime minister did little to improve women s status or reverse Zia ul-Haq s so-called Islamization policies; a secular democrat whose leadership of the Pakistan People s Party and governance as prime minister reflected Pakistan s feudal politics with a record of widespread corruption and human rights violations that were severely criticized by international organizations Like her father she exerted power through an increasingly tough autocratic style one-person dominance or rule She declared herself head of the PPP for life and made no provision for leadership from among her many talented party leaders since the PPP was to remain a family legacy as witnessed by the "selection" of her son and husband The recent political responses to Bhutto s assassination highlight the key problems or fault lines endemic to Pakistani politics today problems that have been exacerbated exponentially in a post-9/11 world Both U S President George W Bush and Pakistan s President Pervez Musharraf were quick to blame al-Qaida and other Muslim extremists and to simply place the assassination within the context of the war on global terrorism and the forces opposed to democracy But as dangerous as these forces are especially with the growth of Pakistani rather than foreign fighters this single-minded scenario ignores the long-standing conflicting currents in Pakistani politics: a deep seated and unresolved identity problem regarding the relationship of Islam to Pakistani national identity and politics; the role of Islamic parties and movements and their clashes with a Westernized elite; a strong military that has resulted in many years of military rather than democratic rule; and the role of feudal political leaders Although Muhammad Ali Jinnah Pakistan s founder and first leader saw Pakistan as a Muslim homeland his socio-cultural understanding was not that of many other more "religiously-minded" leaders Thus while Pakistan adopted a Western political structure many Pakistanis took the country s Islamic identity quite literally and seriously -- as Ayub Khan an early military ruler and modernist learned when he had to back off his attempt to drop Pakistan s title as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto a secular socialist would himself turn to Islam after the Pakistan-Bangladesh civil war in 1971 in order to build bridges to Arab countries counter the Jamaat-i-Islami (Islamic Party) and other religious parties and reinforce his popular base However the appeal to Islam would prove to be a two-edged sword as the Bhutto-appointed head of the army General Zia ul-Haq would use Islam to legitimate his coup the execution of Bhutto and the "Illumination" of Pakistan Ironically years later Nawaz Sharif would also play the religion card in his political struggles with Benazir Bhutto and the PPP Where do we go from here The Pakistan-U S "war on terrorism" and "promotion of democracy" have in fact resulted in a dangerous increase of the former and a threat to the latter Religious extremism and terrorism have grown in Pakistan; extremists will only benefit from the current crisis Islamic politicians and parties (mainstream and extremists) have increased their electoral clout both in the 2002 elections and subsequently nationally including control of both the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan Musharraf s promotion of democracy has at best been a fig leaf both in terms of the manipulation of electoral politics and the role of the military Though Musharraf took off his uniform the generals remain a powerful and influential force capable of intervening at any moment And regrettably the tragic death of Bhutto has resulted in a new stage of Bhutto family feudal leadership of the PPP only this time absent the charisma talents and experience of Benazir Moving forward will require an enlightened leadership At a time when widespread anti-Americanism (more accurately opposition to the Bush administration) in Pakistan has become even more entrenched -- as it has in many parts of the Muslim and non-Muslim world -- one can at least hope for the laying of some groundwork for the emergence of future leaders Musharraf should begin with the restoration of some semblance of democracy by reconstituting Pakistan s supreme court announce a more specific timetable for national elections and seek to work more closely with mainstream and political leaders rather than exploit the current fluid situation and thereby contribute to greater instability The United States given its political and military power retains the ability and leverage to play a more constructive role in Pakistan -- but that will require not simply looking for another "American candidate" to install as Pakistan s leader -- John L Esposito university professor and founding director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University is co-author of "Who Speaks for Islam What a Billion Muslims Really Think " This article is distributed by the Common Ground News Service (CGNews)

Gill: Glazers have been vindicated Manchester United chief executive David Gill has admitted it would have been unimaginable for the Old Trafford club to sign four major stars last summer if they had remained a PLC Although Malcolm Glazer s controversial 790million takeover in 2005 was accompanied by protests from long-standing United supporters groups and the formation of rebel outfit FC United the club have provided the perfect answer to their critics by posting stunning profits of 59 6million for the 12 months to June 2007 - a massive 93% rise on the previous year The figures form part of an impressive set of results which have seen turnover rise to 245million once sales from Nike merchandise and MUTV are added to a group turnover of 210million - a sum which United officials feel entitles them to claim they are once again the richest club in the world With revenue streams increasing in every area and more to come this year once the new vastly-improved Premier League TV deal starts to take effect United are in far healthier shape thananyone could have predicted prior to the Glazer family s involvement And Gill is convinced if the takeover had never happened Sir Alex Ferguson would not have had the funds for his summer blitz which saw the arrivals of Nani Anderson Owen Hargreaves and Carlos Tevez "I wouldn t disagree with the view that it would have been unimaginable to sign those four players if we had still been a PLC " said Gill "There is a new structure in place now and decisions can be made pretty quickly I was on the telephone in Portugal to Joel Glazer over Nani and Anderson He said just do it "It wasn t a long drawn-out affair Tevez and Hargreaves were but for different reasons "The family understand the requirement to have a successful team playing in the Manchester United way and they have backed the manager with funds "Copyright PA Sport 2008 All Rights Reserved

Back to NHL Home The Toronto Maple Leafs hit the road once again as they prepare for a Thursday night tilt with the Boston Bruins at the Gardens The Leafs; who snapped an ugly 5 game slide with a win over Carolina on Tuesday night; will be looking to win consecutive games for the first time in well over a month Overshadowing the game however will be the potential GM change that could occur within the next few days The Leafs have already asked the Coyotes permission to speak with Cliff Fletcher this alone is evidence that the organization is scrambling to replace current GM John Ferguson This change could not come at a better time as Leaf fans at the ACC voiced their displeasure for Ferguson during the third period of Tuesday night s game when Fire Ferguson" erupted throughout the arena Ironically enough the Leafs were winning at the time the chant took place Vesa Toskala is expected to get the start for the Leafs He allowed 4 goals on 25 shots against the Hurricanes This was seen as a shaky outing for the Finnish net minder who has been one of the few bright spots on the team thus far The Bruins will likely counter with journeymen Tim Thomas who has been a pleasant surprise for the Bruins this season Both teams have their fare share of injuries as the Leafs currently have Bryan McCabe Carlo Colaiacovo and Mark Bell shelved with various ailments Alex Steen; who missed Tuesday s game with the flu; is listed as probable as is Nik Antropov who injured his leg in the third period of Tuesday s game For the Bruins they will be without Glen Murray P J Axelsson Patrice Bergeron and Manny Fernandez Given the amount of injuries facing the Bruins it is quite evident that the Leafs need to utilize this to their advantage With an opportunity to string together consecutive wins for the first time in over a month and a potential GM change on the horizon; things may begin to slightly look up in Leafs nation The major question up for debate will now be: does the team try to put together a run under the new GM or do they choose to continue their death spiral and land themselves in the Steve Stamkos sweepstakes Leafs nation will most likely side with the second scenario as most fans have grown tired of the team s state of limbo

House price inflation fell sharply at the end of last year according to the Halifax bank the country s biggest mortgage lender prices were rising at an annual rate of just 5 2% in December half the rate seen just three months earlier CLICK HERE to Capture The World in HD Although prices actually went up by 1 3% during December the Halifax said that was the first time there had been an increase in the past four months This took the value of the average UK home to 197 039 It s not unexpected as since last summer the market has been going through a sharp slowdown partly under the impact of higher interest rates "This mixed pattern of monthly price rises and falls is a typical characteristic of a subdued market " said Martin Ellis Chief Economist at the Halifax "Overall the housing market continued to slow in the final quarter of 2007 with prices slightly lower than in the preceding quarter " he added The lender predicts that house prices will slow down even more this coming year and while it expects them to be flat over the course of 2008 it anticipates the Bank of England will cut interest rates twice in the next 12 months in response to the slowdown in the wider economy Malcolm Barr an economist at the bank JPMorgan Chase said: "We continue to be surprised at the speed in which momentum in house price gains has faded ""That lenders have begun to cite the expectation of house price falls as a reason to tighten credit availability and the data have moved to confirm those expectations remains a significant worry " he added The fact is that houses had become increasingly unaffordable for many potential owners choked off demand in the market by keeping out many potential first-time buyers The Halifax recently reported that there were just 300 000 first-time buyers last year the lowest level since 1980 Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) showed that in November first-time buyers who did take out a loan borrowed an average of 3 33 times their incomes That was the third month in a row that the income multiple of these borrowers has fallen down from a record of 3 39 times income that was reported in July and August "Affordability in the mortgage market continued to show some resilience to tightening credit market conditions " said the CML s Director General Michael Coogan "At a time of global market uncertainty business levels in the mortgage market are holding up reasonably well in the UK despite funding constraints " he concluded(BMcC)

Choi three-shot winner over Sabbatini in Sony WIRE SERVICES Article Launched: 01/14/2008 02:57:26 AM PST K J Choi had to work harder than he imagined to become the Sony Open champion everyone expected Equipped with a four-stroke lead Choi struggled in blustery conditions Sunday at Honolulu s Waialae Country Club and held off a late charge by Rory Sabbatini to close with a 1-over 71 the first Sony Open champion in 41 years with a final round over par That was more a testament to the wind that made birdies scarce Sabbatini managed six birdies in a spirited run at Choi but he three-putted No 18 for par from 65 feet for a closing 68 leaving him three strokes behind "I can t remember having such a difficult round " said Choi who won $954 000 "It was very difficult conditions out there I told myself Try not to lose focus " Choi won for the seventh time on the PGA Tour and for the fourth consecutive season Tiger Woods Phil Mickelson and Vijay Singh are the only other players with active streaks that long But it wasn t easy until the end He didn t make his first birdie until the final hole when the outcome was no longer in doubt Choi finished at 14-under 266 "There were two things that needed to happen today -- K J to lose a few shots back to the field and for someone to go low " Sabbatini said "He kind of did his part but the ones of us that were chasing unfortunately failed to do our jobs and go low enough to maybe change the outcomes " Jerry Kelly closed with a bogey-free 67 to finish alone in third at 270 Only eight players Advertisement broke par Sunday Meanwhile the tour s new cut policy took a quirky turn when Kenneth Ferrie withdrew and received less money than 18 guys who finished behind him even though he qualified for the weekend and they didn t Ferrie withdrew Saturday with food poisoning He was at 4 under and made the cut by three shots But under tour regulations anyone who withdraws or is disqualified for whatever reason after making the cut is paid last place unofficial prize money Ferrie was given $8 798 and no FedEx points With the new tour policy the top 70 and ties make the cut but if the number exceeds 78 players only the closest number to 70 players compete on the weekend Eighteen players including John Daly made the cut but had to go home Those players were paid $9 699 that counts toward the money list and 46 FedEx points In Ferrie s case he would have been better off finishing at even par "It s a stupid rule I m sorry " Daly said PGA European Tour: Richard Sterne made a birdie on the second playoff hole to win the Johannesburg Open The South African closed with a 6-under 65 at the Royal Johannesburg & Kensington Golf Club for a 13-under 271 total tied with Magnus Carlsson (66) and Garth Mulroy (66) Sterne s birdie on the par-5 18th earned him a third tour title

Justine Brian Who gives a cluck about a broiler chicken Ignore the posh fooderati on Channel 4 moaning about the factory-farming of chickens: we should celebrate the freedom provided by mass food production Printer-friendly version Email-a-friend Respond Before the Second World War chicken was a relatively expensive meat with the UK population eating less than a kilo per annum compared to today s average of 23kg per person (1) After the war as part of the government s concerted efforts to ensure the UK was self-sufficient in food and able to move away from postwar rationing (which lasted almost a decade after the war ended) the industrial-scale production of chicken began Today 93 per cent of the fresh chicken we purchase most of it produced in the UK is reared on factory farms advertisement advertise on spiked The issue of how we produce chicken made the front page of last Friday s Independent thanks to a new series of shows on Channel 4 This week the channel launched a season of campaigning programmes called The Big Food Fight starring the channel s three superstar celebrity chefs: restaurateur and king of on-screen swearing Gordon Ramsay; trendy lifestyle chef turned saviour of school meals Jamie Oliver; and Eton-educated smallholder and killer of squirrels bunnies and anything else that might make a good dinner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall In the first strand of this campaigning season Hugh s Chicken Run Fearnley-Whittingstall launches his Chicken Out campaign to persuade UK supermarkets to only stock free-range chicken and to persuade us the consumers to stop buying factory-farmed birds Fearnley-Whittingstall is hardly a friend of vegetarians; his previous exploits in his River Cottage programmes have enraged animal rights campaigners and the squeamish alike Yet in Chicken Run his argument is that factory-farmed chickens suffer whereas free-range ones are happier because of the conditions in which they are kept; he has no problem with eating meat as long as the animals concerned live a natural life Unsurprisingly blanked by the factory chicken farmers of the UK when he asks to visit their farms to demonstrate how cruel they are to their livestock the River Cottage star decides to set up his own small-scale factory chicken farm alongside a free-range farm for comparison with both enterprises run to standard UK farming guidelines The other side to his campaign is to persuade a group of people who would ordinarily buy the factory-farmed two-chickens-for-a-fiver at their local supermarket to try free-range meat Because so many people have opposed his arguments by pleading poverty he persuades a group of people from a run-down local housing estate in his home town of Axminster south-west England to rear their own animals on a section of nearby allotments A group of a dozen-or-so locals go along with the plan though they seem initially more impressed with the fact that they are talking to their neighbours than with the business of farming It may not be a practical way of feeding themselves but you can bet the government s social inclusion advisers were applauding every moment Along the way Fearnley-Whittingstall cooks some really nice food to prove that free-range chicks are best (though a chef-prepared risotto would surely taste good regardless of where the chicken came from); persuades a local tool company s canteen to do a Jamie Oliver that is dump catering cuisine and cook real food instead; and finally as is common to most TV production today he makes some Axminster locals cry about their lifestyle choices (with weeping children for extra moral pressure!) when they visit his factory-farmed bird shed Happily one of the Axminster locals a generously proportioned single mum called Hayley rather impressively refuses to cry or get upset on cue for the cameras The reality of chicken farming is exactly what she imagined it might be like she says She d probably prefer to eat the free-range stuff but she s just fine with intensive farming as it means she can afford to eat chicken and feed her family She clearly hadn t read the script I suspect most people would be surprised perhaps even shocked about what commercial livestock farming looks like and that s because thankfully most of us no longer have to produce our own food and are far removed from the meat products we buy at the supermarket And why shouldn t we be One of the many benefits of the Industrial Revolution was a division of labour in society and in this instance that means that someone else produces my food and distributes it to a central purchasing point near my home while I do some other job I specialise in There is no reason to know who farmed my chicken or how as long as it is produced to some decent minimum standard with human welfare paramount An equivalent of the foodie obsession with the provenance of our food might be for me to demand to visit the Polish mine where the coal that lights and heats my home is extracted so I understand the source of this fuel and how it s produced If I was a real trainspotter I d also want to know the name of the individual Polish miner who personally dug the coal for me As it happens the coal analogy makes more sense than Fearnley-Whittingstall s campaign; I do give a damn about the people who undertake the relatively dangerous task of mining as they are my fellow human beings; I really don t give a stuff about a broiler chicken Fearnley-Whittingstall s premise for his campaign is laid out clearly at the start of the first programme when he says: To me it shouldn t be possible to produce a chicken for 2 50 This is because he thinks that chickens should be produced in a more labour-intensive way (free-range birds grow slower are housed in lower densities and so take more human input to produce an eating bird) In Fearnley-Whittingstall s world the price of the average chicken would be at least double what we currently pay for a supermarket Grade A chicken Presumably a takeaway from KFC and a Marks and Spencer chicken sandwich would become more expensive too Why would we want to make our food more expensive As it happens the animal welfare argument is somewhat bogus What is good for a human being is not necessarily what is good for an animal While animal welfare activists complain about the cramming of chickens into sheds the programme makes clear that the free-range chickens are also at risk from health problems The intensively produced chickens are bred to bulk up quickly and sometimes suffer leg problems as a result The free-range birds exposed to the outside world are at greater risk of disease Good stock management means that the relatively small proportion of chickens that do not thrive in either system due to disease injury or congential problems are swiftly culled Even if farmers were heartless bastards who were careless about animal suffering (which they generally are not) they have a strong economic incentive not to carry on feeding chickens that won t make the grade at the end of the 40-50 days required to fatten them up While humans may find conditions in a broiler shed crowded and boring that doesn t mean that those animals are suffering in any way (2) Chickens are food and producing food efficiently is not unethical If we put animal welfare before human convenience across the range of meat products that we consume as the likes of Fearnley-Whittingstall believe we should the result would be that for many people meat would be a rare treat that they could only eat perhaps once or twice a week Of course that restriction wouldn t apply to the kind of well-off person who laps up the crusades of celebrity chefs frets about their food labels and already pays over-the-odds for ethical posh nosh It s a good thing that people need to spend less of their income on simply sustaining themselves If we have to spend less on the basics of survival then we ve more money to spend on a whole world of other things We may even choose to blow some extra cash on a free-range chicken from time to time but it s better that we can choose if and when we do that rather than having this foisted upon us by others who believe animal welfare is more important than having a bit more cash in our pockets The views put forward in The Big Food Fight season are increasingly common ones espoused by an evangelical fooderati This isn t about chickens at all It s about a disgust at large-scale food production our unhindered consumerism our uneducated palates all-powerful supermarkets and our supposedly gross overconsumption Packing a third less chickens in a factory shed and giving them rubber balls to play with as illustrated in Hugh s Chicken Run is about making us feel a little bit better about eating them The discussion about what s natural for chickens also helps to maintain a Disneyfied image of what farming looks like something that looks rather like the River Cottage world we ve watched over the past few years As Fearnley-Whittingstall says in this new show this isn t farming as I know it But River Cottage shows farming for the privileged few; it s not the way you feed a nation of 60million people For me it s no contest When it comes down to providing good cheap protein for human consumption over the welfare of a 39-day-old chicken the human wins every time As another Axminster local colourfully declares in Hugh s Chicken Run: If you re that bothered about a fucking chicken then don t eat the fucking twatting thing then Justine Brian is national administrator of the UK schools debating competition Debating Matters Read on: spiked-issues: Food and TV (1) The price of poultry BBC (2) Thanks to Mike Clark of Minster Veterinary Practice for background information on chicken welfare and health

2007 campaign Green Bay raised plenty of eyebrows by amassing a 13-3 overall record a five-game improvement over second-year head coach Mike McCarthy s debut season and ran away with the NFC North Division en route to a bye in last week s Wild Card round   The 13 regular-season wins were the Packers most since 1997 a year in which legendary quarterback Brett Favre claimed his third consecutive NFL MVP award and led the storied franchise to its most recent Super Bowl appearance   Favre enjoyed a renaissance as well in 2007 The future Hall of Famer rebounded from back-to-back subpar seasons by throwing for 4 155 yards the third-highest yardage total of his 17-year career and producing a 95 7 quarterback rating that was his best since 1996   The 38-year-old ironman also completed a career-high 66 5 percent of his passes and finished second to New England s Tom Brady in balloting for this year s league MVP proving that Favre s offseason decision to delay retirement was indeed the right call   Green Bay will be seeking its first playoff victory since January 4 2004 when the Pack edged the Seahawks at Lambeau Field in an 33-27 overtime thriller during the NFC s opening round Cornerback Al Harris provided the winning points with a 52-yard interception return of Seattle s Matt Hasselbeck for a touchdown   The third-seeded Seahawks advanced to the divisional round with last Saturday s 35-14 decision over visiting Washington in an NFC Wild Card Playoff Seattle trailed the Redskins by a 14-13 count midway through the fourth quarter but erupted for 22 unanswered points to keep its season alive   Hasselbeck s 20-yard touchdown pass to D J Hackett with 6:06 left to play put the Seahawks ahead and the team put the game out of reach when defensive backs Marcus Trufant and Jordan Babineaux each scored on late interceptions of Washington quarterback Todd Collins   While that win was impressive it also came at Qwest Field where Seattle has gone 8-1 this year Conversely the Seahawks posted a 3-5 road record during the regular season with the last two defeats coming at the hands of also-rans Carolina and Atlanta   Seattle also hasn t had much success away from home on the playoff trail The Seahawks are 1-6 lifetime on the road in postseason games and haven t won one as the visitor since defeating Miami in an AFC Divisional matchup on December 31 1983   The Seahawks have come close to ending that lengthy drought though The club s two most recent road playoff losses were in overtime the previously- mentioned defeat to the Packers and last year s 27-24 setback to eventual NFC champ Chicago at Soldier Field   Green Bay also hasn t enjoyed a great deal of postseason success at home as of late The Packers have dropped two of their last three playoff encounters at Lambeau including a 31-17 upset loss to Minnesota during the 2004 campaign   Saturday s tilt will also pit Green Bay against former head coach and current Seahawks sideline boss Mike Holmgren who directed the Pack to six straight playoff appearances and two Super Bowls during a successful seven-year run from 1992-98   Additionally Hasselbeck spent his first three NFL seasons in Green Bay as Favre s understudy before being brought over to the Seahawks by Holmgren in a 2001 trade   SERIES HISTORY   That 2003 NFC Wild Card Playoff is the only previous postseason meeting between the Packers and Seahawks Green Bay owns a 6-5 lead in its all-time regular season series with Seattle but was a 34-24 road loser when it last faced the Seahawks in Week 12 of the 2006 regular season The Packers were home winners in the previous two regular season matchups in 2003 and 2005 Including playoffs the Seahawks are 0-3 at Lambeau Field since last winning there in 1999   Holmgren is 2-3 against his former team including the 03 playoff loss McCarthy is 0-1 against both Holmgren and the Seahawks as a head coach   WHEN THE SEAHAWKS HAVE THE BALL   Seattle s offensive game plan usually involves spreading the field and having the battle-tested Hasselbeck (3966 passing yards 28 TD 12 INT) throw to a quality corps of receivers that should be bolstered by the expected return of former Super Bowl MVP Deion Branch (49 receptions 4 TD) who sat out last week s game with a strained calf Veteran Bobby Engram (94 receptions 1147 yards 6 TD) has been the most productive member of the group but Hackett (32 receptions 3 TD) led the way in the Wild Card win with 101 yards on six catches Nate Burleson (50 receptions 9 TD) added six grabs for 64 yards and can be dangerous in the open field   The Packers have a good chance of keeping at least two of those receivers in check as their cornerback combo of Harris (37 tackles 2 INT) and Charles Woodson (63 tackles 4 INT) is as formidable as any duo in the league Green Bay does have some depth concerns in its defensive backfield however Woodson has been playing through a nagging toe injury and nickel corner Will Blackmon probably won t play after hurting his foot in the regular-season finale with the untested Tramon Williams (17 tackles 1 INT) likely to fill that role The Packers have held enemy quarterbacks to only a 55 percent completion rate this year the second-best mark in the NFL and garnered 19 interceptions So Hasselbeck who was picked off twice by the Redskins last week will have to be judicious with his reads if the Seahawks are to succeed on Saturday He ll also be facing a strong pass rush headed by ends Aaron Kampman (64 tackles 12 sacks) and Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (26 tackles 9 5 sacks) while underrated tackle Corey Williams (35 tackles 7 sacks) can also get pressure from the interior   An effective running game would make Hasselbeck s task easier but the Seahawks have had their share of troubles in that area throughout the year Seattle ranked just 20th overall in rushing offense (101 2 ypg) during the regular season and mustered a mediocre 77 yards on the ground in last week s playoff win The team does have a former league MVP in its backfield in Shaun Alexander (716 rushing yards 5 total TD) but the declining running back hasn t had a 100-yard effort since September   Green Bay finished 14th in the league in run defense (102 9 ypg) and possesses a solid front seven highlighted by Nick Barnett (131 tackles 3 5 sacks 2 INT) who delivered an excellent all-around season at middle linebacker Athletic youngster A J Hawk (105 tackles 1 sack 1 INT) played well on the weak side while strong safety Atari Bigby (86 tackles 9 PD) was also active in run support in addition to coming up with a team-best five interceptions Linemen Ryan Pickett (39 tackles 1 sack) and Cullen Jenkins (44 tackles 1 sack) are proven stoppers as well who will have the task of slowing down Alexander   WHEN THE PACKERS HAVE THE BALL   The Packers personnel and offensive philosophy is a lot like Seattle s as the team boasts a talented contingent of receivers that should be getting plenty of work from the ageless Favre (4155 yards 28 TD 15 INT) on Saturday The remarkably reliable Donald Driver (82 receptions 1048 yards 2 TD) delivered a fourth straight year with more than 80 catches and 1 000 yards while the dynamic Greg Jennings (53 receptions) scored 12 touchdowns and averaged 17 4 yards per grab in a breakout sophomore season Rookie James Jones (47 receptions 2 TD) also made quite an impact as the No 3 receiver while tight end Donald Lee (48 receptions 6 TD) emerged as one of Favre s favorite targets in the red zone Favre curtailed his trademark gunslinger mentality this year and that wiser approach has resulted in a drastic reduction in turnovers for the NFL s second-ranked passing attack (270 9 ypg)   Favre s turnaround season has been aided by terrific protection from a line that yielded just 19 sacks an impressive number considering how much the Packers throw the ball However the front wall will face quite a challenge this week from a Seattle defense that got to the quarterback 45 times during the regular season and consistently harassed Washington s Collins last Saturday The one-on-one matchups between Seahawk ends Patrick Kerney (62 tackles 14 5 sacks) and Darryl Tapp (49 tackles 7 sacks) and Green Bay s bookend tackle tandem of Chad Clifton and Mark Tauscher will be ones to watch as those battles will go a long way in determining the success of both teams The Packers still have to deal with pass-rushing linebacker Julian Peterson (74 tackles 9 5 sacks 2 INT) as well as a ballhawking secondary headed by Pro Bowl selection Trufant (85 tackles 7 INT 15 PD) Seattle yielded a league-low 15 touchdown passes and forced a healthy 34 turnovers entering the postseason   The Seahawks also played the run extremely well in last week s victory limiting Washington s Clinton Portis to a mere 52 rushing yards on 20 carries Strongside linebacker LeRoy Hill (81 tackles 3 sacks) led the charge with 13 tackles including 11 solo stops and is part of a top-notch trio headlined by three-time Pro Bowler Lofa Tatupu (109 tackles 4 INT 1 sack) in the middle Tatupu finished with 12 tackles against the Redskins For the year Seattle ranked 12th overall in rushing defense (102 8 ypg)   Green Bay was only 21st in the NFL in rushing yards (99 8 ypg) but its once- dormant ground game went from a weakness to a strength when McCarthy inserted Ryan Grant (956 rushing yards 8 TD 30 receptions) as the primary ball- carrier at midseason The former practice squad player had five 100-yard outings over the final 10 games and averaged 5 1 yards per rush on the year Grant also displayed plenty of game-breaking ability as four of his eight touchdown runs were for 27 yards or more   SPECIAL TEAMS   Seattle has a pair of impact return men in Burleson whose average of 11 3 yards per punt return ranked second only to Chicago star Devin Hester in the NFC and rookie Josh Wilson who averaged an eye-opening 27 5 yards taking back kicks during the regular season Green Bay will likely be without its regular punt returner in Blackmon but the club is still in good hands as Tramon Williams had a 94-yard touchdown in a win over Carolina in November The Packers coverage units have been better than those of Seattle s this year   Green Bay kicker Mason Crosby came through with a very strong rookie season and possesses a powerful leg but this will be his first foray into the pressure-packed postseason Seattle s Josh Brown on the other hand is 14- of-17 on field goals during the playoffs for his career Give the Seahawks the edge in the punting department as Ryan Plackemeier was effective at pinning in the opposition while the Packers Jon Ryan had two kicks blocked in a late-year loss at Chicago   OVERALL ANALYSIS   In a game that features the most prolific quarterback in the history of the sport as well as plenty of well-established talent on each side it s ironic that the x-factor is Grant an undrafted player out of college who began this season as Green Bay s fourth-string halfback Both teams have signal-callers with a wealth of big-game experience and moxie excellent skill and depth at the receiver positions and sturdy defenses that are very good at pressuring the passer But the Packers do have one potential clear advantage provided they re able to get the running game churning out yards like it did during the second half of the season Conversely if the Seahawks can shut down Grant there s no reason to think they can t win this game Forget about Seattle s dubious history on the road -- the team came within a whisker of winning its last two playoff tests away from home and went toe-to-toe with quality clubs like Cleveland and Philadelphia as the visitor earlier this year Still the Packers are a little bit stronger along both lines of scrimmage and should run the ball well enough to keep Seattle s opportunistic defense honest Therefore give the home team a slight edge in what should be a hard-fought and entertaining

signal-callers with a wealth of big-game experience and moxie excellent skill and depth at the receiver positions and sturdy defenses that are very good at pressuring the passer But the Packers do have one potential clear advantage provided they re able to get the running game churning out yards like it did during the second half of the season Conversely if the Seahawks can shut down Grant there s no reason to think they can t win this game Forget about Seattle s dubious history on the road -- the team came within a whisker of winning its last two playoff tests away from home and went toe-to-toe with quality clubs like Cleveland and Philadelphia as the visitor earlier this year Still the Packers are a little bit stronger along both lines of scrimmage and should run the ball well enough to keep Seattle s opportunistic defense honest Therefore give the home team a slight edge in what should be a hard-fought and entertaining contest Sports Network Predicted Outcome: Packers 28

Bush declares flooded Nev town disaster By SANDRA CHEREBAssociated Press Writer MOST-READ STORIES President Bush declared part of northern Nevada a national disaster area Tuesday making federal relief available to hundreds of people whose homes were swamped by a weekend levee rupture Bush signed the declaration as building inspectors went door to door in the town of Fernley to assess millions of dollars in damage from the flood caused by a break in a century-old irrigation canal early Saturday The declaration makes available federal assistance including grants for temporary housing and home repairs the White House press office said It also can be used to make low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and entails other programs to help individuals and business owners recover Flood waters continued to drain in the fast-growing community 30 miles east of Reno City Manager Gary Bacock said water in the hardest-hit areas was down to curb high - a big improvement but little consolation to residents who awoke Saturday to find water gushing into their homes Water collected 8 feet deep in some areas after a large swath of the earthen levee gave way and a 2-foot wave of water swamped the neighborhood More than a dozen residents were rescued by helicopter from rooftops while others were taken to safety by boats The canal is owned by the U S Bureau of Reclamation but managed by the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District That will make it difficult to determine liability Jeff Page Lyon County s emergency services director told about 400 residents during a Monday night meeting "So that s going to be an issue who is responsible for what and that s an answer I don t know " Page said "Hopefully when it comes time to fund it they will look at that it s a federal property and that will help push the directive to get done " Bacock said teams of building inspectors including volunteers from as far away as Las Vegas were assessing nearly 600 homes to determine whether they were inhabitable He said large trash bins are being placed along the streets so residents can dispose of the muck and trash Gov Jim Gibbons on Saturday declared the area a disaster the first step toward seeking a federal disaster designation In his request to the White House he included initial repair and cleanup estimates approaching $4 million and indicated that follow-up assessments could push that total higher On Tuesday Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid D-Nev said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff called him to pledge assistance to Nevada s flood victims "I greatly appreciate Secretary Chertoff taking the time to personally call me and promise that the people of Fernley will get everything they need in the wake of the levee break " Reid said The 31-mile-long canal takes water from the Truckee River near Reno and delivers it to farms around Fallon 60 miles east of Reno A similar rupture in the same vicinity flooded 60 homes in December 1996 Associated Press writers Martin Griffith and Scott Sonner in Reno and Brendan Riley in Carson City contributed to this report

Court seems to back Indiana voter ID law 1/10/2008 3:50 a m EST By MARK SHERMAN The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) The Supreme Court appeared ready Wednesday to uphold the nation s strictest requirement that voters show photo identification before casting a ballot The justices are faced with a partisan dispute that echoes the bitterly divided decision that sealed the 2000 presidential election for George W Bush Now as then the court seemed divided along ideological lines Wednesday s arguments were over a challenge to an Indiana law passed in 2005 that is backed by Republicans as a prudent way to deter voter fraud Democrats and civil rights groups oppose the law as unconstitutional and call it a thinly veiled effort to discourage elderly poor and minority voters those most likely to lack proper ID and who tend to vote for Democrats But Justice Anthony Kennedy often a key vote on the court did not sound persuaded that the challengers had made their case "You want us to invalidate a statute on the ground that it s a minor inconvenience to a small percentage of voters " Kennedy said near the end of the lively session Kennedy did however voice concern over some aspects of obtaining an ID including the difficulty the poor have in getting the birth certificates that are needed to get photo ID More than 20 states require some form of identification at the polls Courts have upheld voter ID laws in Arizona Georgia and Michigan but struck down Missouri s The Indiana case should be decided by late June in time for the November elections The justices could use the case to instruct courts on how to weigh claims of voter fraud versus those of disenfranchisement Paul Smith representing the challengers told the justices that there is no evidence of in-person voter fraud in Indiana He said the law is a subtle way "to skew the outcome on election days " Indiana Solicitor General Thomas Fisher said the vast majority of Indiana voters easily comply with the law "You re talking about an infinitesimal portion of the electorate that could be burdened " Fisher said under sharp questioning from Justice David Souter Justice Samuel Alito who appeared more sympathetic to Indiana s case posed the question that troubled several justices CONTINUED 1 | 2 Next

Graceful girl in a similar world Get Arts and Entertainment Feeds By LESLIE BREFELDSummit Daily News Comments Print Email I caught the film Juno recently As those who ve seen the trailers know the movie is about a girl named Juno (played by Ellen Page) who finds herself pregnant and in high school After a few hours of deliberation I realized that what stands out the most in the film is what is not there any religious tones or moral judgments It s strange to see (or really not to see) in a movie on this topic strange and refreshing It s like it was created for a new generation one with a perspective of tolerance The comforting nature of the film continues with Juno s family There s a thread of love between characters including her parents Bren and Mac (played by Allison Janney and J K Simmons) her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) and her other best friend and the father of her child Paulie Bleeker (played by Michael Cera) Each character adds to the film s sweetness The music is worth noting too The soundtrack sets a tone of whimsy among the complex ideas being dealt with Also Juno s charisma her coolness is rooted in the depth of the music she plays and listens to Juno has a striking certainty confidence and with it she moves with the flow of life In so doing she also guides the movement of the film s story Juno may not make you think but in all likelihood it will make you feel and mostly good at that

Freed Colombian hostages tell how they survived Just in case the hostages were ever tempted to escape into the jungle the guerrillas brought in big wild cats and snakes to demonstrate exactly what awaited outside their "people s jail " Politicians Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonzalez said they were kept behind barbed wire and forced to march through the jungle for days or even weeks They slept on hammocks or plastic sheets and when Rojas tried to escape she was sent to bed with an iron shackle around her neck The two women were held for more than six years by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC as political pawns in a quest to force the government into offering a massive prisoner swap or a demilitarized zone for peace talks After a 20-day march through the jungle they were freed Thursday following the intervention of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who was willing to negotiate with the rebels when the Colombian government would not In their first media interviews since Thursday s release the women told Colombian radio stations about their moments of despair - like the times they went on hunger strikes and struggled to find the energy to even bathe "It s surprising the capacity of human beings to face these situations " Gonzalez said "The only thing you can do is survive because there s just nothing else to do " During her captivity Gonzalez became a grandmother and a widow Rojas 44 had a relationship with a rebel fighter and gave birth in the jungle to a boy named Emmanuel who she said became her salvation Rojas had little to say about her son s father but said the baby gave her cause to pull it together and splash a little water on her face every day eat and exercise When mosquitoes pestered or the food was too sweet or too salty and others thought it was poisoned Rojas would remind herself: "I m not in a fine restaurant " Gonzalez recalled the rotating menu: rice with peas rice with lentils rice with beans and rice with pasta If they were lucky rebels would kill a wild animal and they got a treat of meat "When they say get up and walk you have to be in the condition to survive " Rojas said "So I decided to exercise 45 minutes every day so I could be ready the day I was reunited with my son " The child is in foster care in Bogota and is expected to be reunited with his mother soon according to the head of the Colombian Family Welfare Institute Rojas was kidnapped in February 2002 while working as an aide to her good friend presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt The two were snatched by the FARC as they drove toward the southern town of San Vicente del Caguan Rojas said she and Betancourt made a decision early in their captivity to escape their captors They slipped out one night but quickly found themselves disoriented and fighting Should they turn left Right "We got lost " Rojas said "We didn t know whether to go one way or the other so they caught us Because of the very darkness or the very jungle we never managed to orient ourselves " The incident strained their relationship They were punished with shackles for 30 days but still fared better than the captured police officers Those men are in chains around the clock - even when they shower and sleep - and some have been held for as long as a decade When Rojas and Betancourt were returned to camp they barely talked "It was a very sad situation " Rojas said But when Rojas found herself pregnant in late 2003 she knew she could turn to her friend who stood by her during a difficult pregnancy that resulted in a Caesarean section Next page > (c) 2008 The Miami Herald

Finjan Inc s Malicious Code Research Center (MCRC) has identified yet another significant new web attack - the latest in a genre of crimeware that threatens to turn highly trusted web sites into insidious traps for unwary visitors More than 10 000 websites in the US were infected in December by this latest malware The attack which Finjan has designated random js toolkit is an extremely elusive crimeware Trojan that infects an end user s machine and sends data from the machine via the Internet to the Trojan s master a cybercriminal Data stolen by the Trojan can include documents passwords surfing habitats or any other sensitive information of interest to the criminal The random js toolkit was detected while diagnosing users web traffic during December 2007 The attack is described in detail in Finjan s latest Malicious Page of the Month report The report explores the new attack vector in depth providing an illustration of the attack in action as captured in the wild ; an analysis of the effectiveness of its evasive techniques; examples of high-ranked and trusted domains that were compromised by this attack technique; and an analysis of a successful exploitation The random js toolkit is a JavaScript code that is created dynamically and changes every time it is being accessed As a result it is almost impossible to be detected by traditional signature-based anti-malware products Explained Finjan CTO Yuval Ben-Itzhak Signaturing a dynamic script is not effective Signaturing the exploiting code itself is also not effective since these exploits are changing continually to stay ahead of current zero-day threats and available patches Keeping an up-to-date list of highly-trusted-doubtful domains serves only as a limited defense against this attack vector What s needed to counter this exploit is dynamic code inspection technology that can detect and block an attack in real time Ben-Itzhak said This technology doesn t depend on the origin URL signature or the site s reputation but inspects the Web content in real-time as served It analyzes the code s intentions before enabling it be executed on the end-user browser Ben-Itzhak noted that the random js toolkit is an example of the recent trend among cybercriminals to undermine trusted web sites In mid-year 2007 studies showed there were nearly 30 000 new infected web pages being created every day About 80 percent of those pages hosting malicious software or containing drive-by downloads with damaging content were located on hacked legitimate sites Today the situation is much worse The random js attack is performed by dynamic embedding of scripts into a webpage It provides a random filename that can only be accessed once This dynamic embedding is done in such a selective manner that when a user has received a page with the embedded malicious script once it will not be referenced again on further requests This method prevents detection of the malware in later forensic analyses Finjan s research into the random js toolkit found that around 10 000 legitimate domains served the malicious code in December Among the infected web sites Finjan identified highly trusted domains Finjan alerted administrators of both sites and the malicious code was subsequently removed from the sites and is no longer active Related topics: Hacking and intrusion prevention Internet and Web security Virus Worm Email security spyware and malware Print version | Email to a friend | Related articles

By Francois Murphy PARIS Jan 8 (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy defended on Tuesday his decisions to congratulate his Russian counterpart on an election victory and invite Libya s Muammar Gaddafi both of which have drawn strong criticism In a two-hour news conference attended by more than 500 journalists Sarkozy covered a wide range of issues but on the diplomatic front he stuck largely to defending his record after he came under fire last month over Gaddafi s five-day visit "Honestly the slightly ridiculous hullabaloo on the visit of Mr Gaddafi " Sarkozy told reporters referring to widespread criticism last month of his decision to invite Gaddafi including from within his own government Paris and Tripoli signed billions of euros in business deals during the visit Gaddafi s first to Paris for 34 years prompting rights groups and the opposition to accuse Sarkozy of putting contracts before human rights Sarkozy said Gaddafi s trip was justified because he had renounced his weapons of mass destruction programme and enabled the release of six foreign medics imprisoned in Libya for infecting children with HIV Opinion polls showed the French public disapproved of the visit by a man who paid compensation for the families of victims of the 1989 mid-air bombing of a UTA airliner over the west African country of Niger Sarkozy who met Gaddafi twice said the Libyan leader was received warmly but denied he had been given particularly extravagant treatment "There was no pomp none He stayed five days because he wanted to stay for five days before leaving for Spain There was no particular pomp There wasn t even a big state dinner that is to say those dinners with 300 or 400 people " he said "PERFECTLY RIDICULOUS" Sarkozy was also asked about his phone call to Russian President Vladimir Putin last month to congratulate him on his party s victory in a widely criticised parliamentary election Few European leaders congratulated Putin and Sarkozy s move put him at odds with close ally Germany which called the vote "neither free fair nor democratic" by Western standards "It is perfectly ridiculous to hold against Mr Putin an election when absolutely all its international observers will tell you that he is the most popular politician in Russia and that independently of the problems that indisputably occurred in this election he would have been elected anyway " Sarkozy said The French president also reiterated that criticising Putin on the election would have made it more difficult to ask him for his help in dealing with "crises" such as Iran s nuclear programme or the violence in Darfur "I prefer to congratulate Putin while asking him: Why did you do that But bravo all the same for being elected Rather than silencing myself when I go to Moscow " Sarkozy defended French policies towards Lebanon Syria and Algeria reiterating that he wanted to help developing states including the Arab world acquire civilian nuclear technology He repeated that he wanted the Group of Eight industrialised nations (G8) to become the G13 which he has said would involve granting membership to Mexico South Africa Brazil and India Sarkozy also said France backed the expansion of the U N Security Council s permanent membership to include Germany Japan Brazil India and an African country (Additional reporting by Brian Rohan)

Dean Ryan struggled to hide his frustration after Gloucester s Heineken Cup horror show against the Ospreys The Guinness Premiership leaders subsided to a 32-15 Pool Two defeat at the Liberty Stadium and had three players sin-binned "It was obviously frustrating We started poorly we allowed them to build an early lead and we were far too late getting into the physicality of the contest " said head Coach Ryan "I am frustrated we ended up playing with 13 men If one of the yellow cards was for swearing then it is something that needs application across the game "The word Narraway used was not personal as far as I know and I have not read a law about swearing I just need some clarity Story continues ADVERTISEMENT "We have got to win next weekend and if we do then we will go through to the quarter-finals as pool winners "We have got to get a bit angry during the week become a bit more focused and use this result as motivation " Ospreys coach Lyn Jones said: "Justin Marshall was man of the match by a country mile I was on my feet applauding too - it was one of the best individual performances we ve ever seen at the Liberty Stadium "That was as satisfying as any other game we have played in the Heineken Cup I thought we were the better side for 70 minutes and we have now played ourselves into a position of having to go to France next weekend and win a game of rugby " The Ospreys could end up going to Gloucester in the quarter-finals especially if the west country club finish as top seeds and Jones added: "Gloucester are a tough quality outfit and if we were to play them in the quarter-finals then it would be a hell of a game "

------------------------------------------------------------
Former New Zealand players have lambasted the Australians for having "double standards" on sledging and said they should be ashamed of their "gutless and churlish" charge of racial abuse against Harbhajan Singh Launching a scathing attack on their trans-Tasmanian neighbours the players -- John Morrison Dipak Patel and Simon Doull -- said the the Australians were themselves so foul-mouthed that they had no moral right to complain about others Morrison who played for New Zealand in the 1970s and 80s said "They ve basically run off to tell the teacher on Harbhajan Singh " "If the Aussies have any conscience at all surely they d be ashamed over this because it s just gutless it s churlish it s childish - the sort of thing you d see in a playground " he was quoted as saying in the Dominican Post "A lot of good cricket people around the world will not like what s happened here " he added Former captain Stephen Fleming said the matter which looked a bit "schoolboyish" initially became a mess because of lack of independent evidence "The Harbhajan aspect is interesting It sounds like there is a case there to be answered it s the player s word against another - without the match officials it s very messy " Fleming was quoted as saying by NZPA "It does look a little bit schoolboyish though the racial issue does cause concern for a lot of players There s been a big push to stamp it out " he added Patel meanwhile felt the Aussies have dished far worse of their "mental disintegration" to act so sensitive on Harbhajan "I m not saying that he (Harbhajan) is not guilty but there s been a lot worse said by Australians in the past to other opposition " Patel said "What happens on the park should stay on the park I ve been called a lot worse than a monkey to be honest with you and it s just something that you accept and it s left on the field " Patel opined Doull a former fast bowler felt the case against Harbhajan hardly stands in the absence of any independent evidence "From my point of view the match referee is there to do a job If the umpires or the match referee haven t seen it or heard it there s no case at all to answer " he said "Did Michael Clarke go in front of the committee when the ball bounced in front of him and he claimed a catch Did Ponting go in front of a committee for nicking one down legside and not walking and then showing dissent when he nicks one on to his pads and gets given out lbw " he asked "It would appear that there s double standards at the moment " he pointed out Former great Martin Crowe meanwhile was worried about the game s future Without commenting on the ongoing furore Crowe said "I worry about the game full stop and you have to go to the core problem The game is not run by anyone in particular it s run by all sorts of people doing their own thing The ICC needs some governance and they need to be given it very very quickly otherwise it will splinter off " "The ICC the way it stands doesn t really have any power The major nations of the game have to all come together and create these laws that charge the ICC with the right powers " Crowe said Fleming said the Australians are known to play hard and put pressure on umpires with aggressive appealing and it was important to retain some of that fire in the game or else it would become dull "How do you deem pressure Is it excessive appealing Is it appealing ball after ball if it hits the pads is it having 10 fielders around the bat " he asked "If we keep diluting it the game can become a bit boring To have a bit of controversy when you re not involved is not a bad thing " he said

TAMWORTH S population of about 50 000 will more than double in the next 10 days as fans from around Australia gather for the Country Music Festival and to celebrate the Golden Guitar Awards given to the best performers of the year This year s festival kicks off today and runs until 27 January After 36 years of festivals Tamworth and country music are inexorably linked Along the way the city has provided a showcase for the best of Australia s country music talent such as Kasey Chambers Keith Urban Lee Kernaghan and the legendary Slim Dusty to be seen by the rest of the world The origin of the country music festival was a response to the domination of television entertainment By the time TV came to Tamworth in April 1965 the new medium had already had an deleterious impact on cinema radio and concert attendances in the big cities Related Sections It had a similar effect in the country but Tamworth station 2TM offered alternatives including a 30-minute evening program called Hoedown hosted by John Minson The country music show was a huge hit and was increased to an hour and eventually four hours The interest generated in country music spawned an association the Modern Country Music Association (now defunct) In 1968 the MCMA held a talent contest on the Australia Day long weekend; it became the basis for a festival It was not the first innovation to come from Tamworth In 1888 Tamworth was the first town in the southern hemisphere to have its streets lit by electricity Minson was a driving force in transforming Tamworth and its rich farming lands into a country music centre along with other radio executives including Max Ellis who became a Tamworth Festival and Awards chief executive It was not always easy In 1984 for instance rain pelted the showground s indoor arena roof so heavily that no one could hear what was being said on stage Other presentations of the Golden Guitars took place in the town hall high schools and in 1991 at various sites around town The mobile presentation was a protest against the lack of a permanent home for the awards The awards had had nine homes by then and fans and performers resented the uncertainty The popularity of the awards had grown to the stage where fans were clamouring for admission but limited seating at the venues meant it was not much better than an industry get-together An industry group was formed headed by Slim Dusty his wife Joy McKean John Williamson Phil Matthews and Max Ellis Money-raising included a big-name concert at Tamworth Showground that drew 4000 spectators The protesters were rewarded by the building of the Tamworth Regional Entertainment Centre (TREC) in the late 1990s The awards night had been run by 2TM but when the artists formed the Country Music Association in 1991 they assumed responsibility for the presentation The multi-purpose entertainment centre is a long way from the humble beginnings of the Golden Guitar Awards in 1973 Joy McKean received the first award for her classic Lights On The Hill sung by her husband the inimitable Slim Dusty Throughout the following years Slim went on to win 37 Golden Guitars; the most bestowed on any performer On January 26 more than 4000 people will fill TREC to see the Golden Guitars presented to the best performers in country music Hovering somewhere will be the ghosts of the great country music figures who kept the music going under extreme difficulties In the 1950s and 60s country music had no friends especially among big-city radio stations It was seen as hillbilly music and was washed away by the newly arrived sounds of rock n roll It was left to Slim Dusty and his wife Joy and other touring groups to battle their way over sand dunes and unpaved roads in stifling temperatures to take their music to the Outback where it was popular Even though the tours would continue Tamworth gave country music a foundation home In the 1980s its influence became more widespread with innovative ideas designed to discover the best talent through talent shows The winners of the Starmaker Quest have included Lee Kernaghan Beccy Cole Gina Jeffreys and Keith Urban Other stars took a more colourful route to fate via busking along the famed Peel St that runs gun-barrel straight through the town centre Troy Cassar-Daley busked in shop doorways singing for cash from passers-by while hoping to attract record company interest "It was great fun " he says "You played for as long as you could and hoped to earn enough to keep you going while you stayed in Tamworth I look back now and realise I loved every minute of it " Cassar-Daley is country music s equivalent of the showbusiness message to newcomers making their debut on the stage of: "You re going out there as an unknown but you re coming back a star " In 1994 while busking he caught the attention of a record executive In 1996 he returned to Tamworth to receive the Golden Guitar as Male Vocalist Of The Year Kasey Chambers now an Australian superstar in country and pop busked on Peel St with her family band The Dead Ringers "I know I ll never forget those days " Chambers says "They were really special " A guest star with the Dead Ringers was often family friend Beccy Cole now a superstar herself "It was a tremendous thrill " Cole says "I owe Tamworth a lot " People of all walks of life are drawn to Tamworth in January for the festival including rugby league star Laurie Daley It also provided the footballer with his most embarrassing moment Daley persuaded his mate Troy Cassar-Daley to sing a duet with him at a licenced club They settled on a Slim Dusty classic Leave Him In The Longyard Daley waited patiently in the audience for his call to the mic and when it came he walked out and primed himself to sing But nothing came out "I forgot the words " Daley says "I couldn t think of anything " For 10 days country music fans will sleep in motel beds in tents in billets caravan parks and even their cars to be part of the scene They will generate good times endless memories and according to mayor James Treloar pour as much as $40 million into the city s coffers "It s the biggest musical festival of its kind in Australia and one of the biggest in the world " Treloar says "We re proud to have seen the festival grow the way it has and proud to be a part of it "

The battle between competing high-definition DVD formats is over it has been claimed Las Vegas gambles on cool gadgets Evolution not revolution at the Consumer Electronics Show HD DVD group cancels Las Vegas launch The Blu-ray Disc Association said that consumer demand for Blu-ray products meant that it rather than the competing HD-DVD format would be the preferred choice for next-generation home entertainment Not going quietly: Toshiba s Akio Ozaka doesn t seem to think the format war is over "Blu-ray s emergence as the format of choice is now inevitable " said Steve Beeks president of Lionsgate one of the film studios backing the Blu-ray format "Last year was a very strong year for Blu-ray but we believe 2008 will be the watershed year for Blu-ray acceptance " Both HD-DVD and Blu-ray have been locked in a lengthy battle for supremacy that recalls the tussle between VHS and Betamax video in the 1980s HD-DVD has the backing of Toshiba and Microsoft and support from film studios Universal and Paramount while Blu-ray is championed by Sony and backed by entertainment giants including Fox and Disney High-definition DVDs have a bigger storage capacity than conventional DVDs and can therefore produce better sound quality and crisper pictures Last week Warner Bros signed a deal to release its movies exclusively on Blu-ray discs leaving HD-DVD with the backing of just two major Hollywood studios advertisement Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas the Blu-ray Disc Association said that sales of Blu-ray DVDs accounted for almost two-thirds of all high-definition discs sold and that they expected the market to undergo "explosive growth" in the coming year They said that sales of the PlayStation 3 which doubles as a Blu-ray video player had been instrumental in achieving these figures "Blu-ray delivers the definitive high-definition experience " said Ron Sanders president of Warner Bros home entertainment division He denied press speculation that Warner Bros had received a payment from the Blu-ray Disc Association to exclusively back its format "The consumer is what influenced us in the end " he said "Warner Bros is a $42bn home-entertainment business Any payment would have been a drop in the ocean compared to getting it wrong with the consumer " Disney underlined its commitment to the format by announcing that it would be releasing Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray disc in 2009 If this does mark the end of the format war it will come as a relief to consumers who have been reluctant to splash out on technology that could become obsolete Most have opted to bide their time to see who emerges as the winner while others have bought expensive DVD players that can play both HD-DVD and Bu-ray discs However industry analyst Michael Gartenberg sounded a note of caution "The news that Warner is going Blu-ray exclusive is big news and a blow to the HD-DVD folks but this doesn t mean that either format will win the hearts and minds of consumers " he said "Perhaps if it had happened a year ago it would have been a knock-out punch but now I am not so sure "There s a good chance that consumers will simply ignore both formats and sit this one out " Toshiba also defended the HD-DVD format saying that all was not lost "We remain firm in the belief HD-DVD is the format best suited to the wants and needs of consumers " said Akio Ozaka head of Toshiba consumer products in the US Within a few years the entire format war could be irrelevant anyway predict industry analysts as consumers become increasingly comfortable with downloading films and television shows on-demand via the internet and watching them on their TVs As if to underline the point BT announced on Monday that users of its BT Vision video-on-demand service would soon be able to download movies and programmes from the service via their Xbox 360 games consoles as well as through their set-top box

former members of Saddam Hussein s Baath party reclaim government jobs or pensions Rice who split off from President Bush s Mideast tour for a surprise visit to Baghdad said the Iraqi parliament s approval Saturday of the U S -sought benchmark law was a first step and showed that last year s "surge" of American forces was paying dividends "It is clearly a step forward for national

responsibility for internal security until 2012 and be unable to defend its borders until at least 2018 "According to our calculations and our timelines we think that from the first quarter of 2009

external threats our calculation appears that we are not going to be able to answer to any external threats until 2018 to 2020 " he said Rice left Riyadh the Saudi capital to personally convey Bush s encouragement about signs of progress in Baghdad "I hope we will focus on what needs to be done but also on how much has been done " Rice said Although national reconciliation "has not always moved as

presence caused the fire though aircraft often release flares to ward off ground attacks The U S military did not immediately respond to a request for comment The fire at the Shuaiba refinery started at 7 a m "due to an explosion " said Assem Jihad the Oil Ministry spokesman He said firefighters were able to control the fire "which hit the gas unit " and that production was continuing Basra where

"We ain t played against a zone like that " UA guard Jawann McClellan said shaking his head The Sun Devils defense an aggressive 2-3 zone carried over from last year is eighth in the country in fewest points allowed and enables the team to run off turnovers "Guys know how to play even without the offense " Pendergraph said "You see James at the end of the shot clock he s drawing fouls on guys that are older than him Seniors and juniors he s making them look like freshmen " This season freshmen James Harden (17 6 points per game) and Ty Abbott (10 4) have helped Sendek return to the flex a Princeton-like approach where all five players can face the basket with aplomb Center Jeff Pendergraph and point guard Derek Glasser have learned the system better When coach Herb Sendek arrived on campus before last season he planned to use his trademark "flex" offense and aggressive man-to-man defense Neither stuck because the Sun Devils players weren t athletic or talented enough Thanks to an influx of talent and a tweaked offensive system the Sun Devils are blowing away last year s meager offensive numbers Making the NCAA tournament and winning more than 20 games were among the goals second-year coach Herb Sendek set for ASU which was 8-22 last season UA Sports ASU basketball Devils on cloud nine after surprising start Players believe ASU can reach Sendek s goals Arizona Daily Star Tucson Arizona | Published: 01 09 2008 advertisement TEMPE Before the basketball season started at the Maui Invitational coach Herb Sendek gathered the Sun Devils and wrote down a list of goals for the season Jeff Pendergraph the team s second-leading scorer and leading rebounder remembered Tuesday what he thought of his coach s expectations "We can do that " he said going down the metaphorical list "We can do that That s gonna be tough That s gonna be tough That one hmm " After all the Sun Devils went 8-22 last season "They kind of seemed a little bit far for us in the beginning " Pendergraph said "But that s because I don t think we knew what we were capable of " The list included holding serve in Pac-10 home games finishing conference road trips on a positive note making the NCAA tournament and winning more than 20 games "Some of the goals coming off last year we didn t know what to expect " starting point guard Derek Glasser said "We didn t know how good some of the freshmen were going to be or how well we d come together "One of the things was 20-plus wins You ve got to be a really good team to get 20 wins especially in the Pac-10 We re at 12 so we ll see what happens " Entering the most relevant UA-ASU basketball matchup in years an air of confidence has permeated the Sun Devils ASU (12-2) is 2-0 in Pac-10 play for the third time in 30 years The Sun Devils are in the midst of an eight-game win streak for the second time since 1983 "It doesn t seem like it s really going to be a landslide victory with them " Pendergraph said Maybe that s the point The Sun Devils have won more games already this season than they did all last year and have matched their conference victory total from the 2006-07 season Pendergraph is getting stopped at the grocery store by fans and not just the usual hard-core alumni who were the only ones to recognize him his first two years on campus "Man this is crazy " he remembers thinking "It s everywhere " Sendek rarely speaking above a whisper Tuesday wasn t ready to declare full-blown hoops mania He joked he had not noticed much of change because he doesn t go to the grocery store and that the only stops he makes between home and work might come because of a traffic ticket "I think there s been an escalation in buzz for some time " said the professorial coach "I don t think that s like this week or last week I think there s been a gradual excitement building around the basketball program " It s easy to see The Sun Devils won six of their first eight games before defeating No 17 Xavier on Dec 15 by 22 points the largest victory against a ranked team in school history Guard James Harden the Pac-10 s Player of the Week has emerged as the team s leading scorer with 17 6 points per game despite being the youngest competitor in the conference The Sun Devils defeated Oregon and Oregon State last week by a combined 27 points But a win against the Wildcats who have defeated ASU in 24 of the past 25 meetings would send ASU fans from a simmer to a rolling boil Pendergraph has tried to explain the rivalry to Harden and other newcomers His most vivid memory came last season at McKale Center when a fan spit on his head before warm-ups "We try to tell them that it s no joke that these guys are coming in to try to blow us out the gym " he said "You can prepare them so much but they have to take the test " Buzz and excitement and expectations are new to the ASU program The team is close to selling out Wells Fargo Arena for the first time since the UA game in 2005 But once the game starts the Sun Devils will try to justify the attention and the expectations written by their coach at the beginning of the year "You can say anything you want " Sendek said "You can believe anything you want You can think what you want But then it has to be backed up with a lot of hard work and improvement and you have to overcome adversities "You have to do it Saying it s one thing; doing it s another "

Sri Lankan Rebels Breakaway Faction Still Recruiting Child Soldiers Sri Lankan Rebels Breakaway Faction Still Recruiting Child Soldiers The separatist Tamil Tiger rebels and a breakaway group known as the Tamil Makkal Viduthali Pulikal (TMVP)/Karuna faction continue to abduct children to fight as soldiers in the bloody conflict in Sri Lanka Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a new report made public today Covering the period from 1 November 2006 to 14 September 2007 the 20-page report noted that "both parties have failed to cease the abduction recruitment and use of children " The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the TMVP/Karuna faction - which split from the Tamil Tigers and now supports Government troops - have also failed to "release all children associated with their forces and engage in transparent procedures for release and verification " which includes allowing the UN Task Force on monitoring and reporting full access to military locations under their control Mr Ban wrote Between 1 November 2006 and 31 August 2007 some 262 children were recruited by the LTTE including 32 who were re-recruited according to reports received by the UN Children s Fund (UNICEF) This represents a significant decrease as compared to the previous 12-month period when 756 children were reportedly recruited including 97 who were re-recruited Despite some advances in dialogue between UNICEF and the LTTE s so-called Child Protection Authority which deals with child recruitment issues there have been several hurdles such as the LTTE s insistence that only children born after 1 January 1990 - who are 17 years old - would be released This is in disregard of both international and national legal standards which state that 18 years is the minimum age of recruitment Meanwhile the number of children recruited by the TMVP/Karuna faction rose to 207 between 1 November 2006 and 31 August 2007 from 193 in the previous-12 month period UNICEF said "Despite initial engagement on an action plan the TMVP/Karuna faction demonstrated bad faith on a number of occasions including leading the United Nations to a falsified training camp in Batticaloa and re-recruiting children within days of releasing them in the presence of UNICEF " the report stated "As of September 2007 the TMVP/Karuna faction has not demonstrated a full commitment to stop recruiting children and has not released all children within their ranks " it added Mr Ban applauded the Sri Lankan Government s creation in April 2007 of a special task force on children and armed conflict and called on authorities to take measures to prevent armed groups abduction and recruitment of children as soldiers and to secure the release of current child soldiers He urged all sides to abide by the recommendations of his previous report in which he appealed for peace and for the cessation of the recruitment of children as soldiers The prior report also asked all parties to "recognize and commit to maintaining the neutrality and security of schools hospitals and religious institutions as safe zones in conflict-affected areas " Source: United Nations judythpiazza@newsblaze com Tags: Politics top news World

The benchmark Sensex at its last close of 20 206 95 points is now just short by 291 16 points from the record of 20 498 11 set on 13 December The S&P CNX Nifty of the National Stock Exchange at its last close of 6 079 70 points is short by 105 70 points from its own all-time high During the week the Bombay Stock Exchange s Sensex gained 1 044 38 points despite uncertainties in the US and volatility from expiry of derivative contracts for December Now the Sensex looks all set to touch a new high early in the new year This despite no dearth of negative data from the US But the Sensex and Nifty gains highlight the Indian bourses firm footing However this will be put to test once again in what is shaping up to be a data-heavy week in the US numbers that will throw light on whether the US economy is headed into a recession The indications from last week do hint at the US economy tilting towards a recession A sharp fall in the US new home sales data revived concerns that more trouble is brewing in the American housing and mortgage market and that the problem may be far from getting over The US new home sales fell to the slowest sales pace in 12 years well above the expectations However contrary to sentiments generated by this number a gain in the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago s business index was a pleasant surprise as it raised hopes that all is not wrong with the US economy This week global bourses including India will closely watch key US numbers such as the report on existing home sales that is scheduled for release on Monday the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index on Wednesday as well as the US Fed s minutes from 11 December monetary policy meeting when it had cut rates by a quarter-percentage point auto industry s reports on Thursday on car and truck sales weekly jobless claims data also on Thursday and most importantly the non-farm payrolls report which is now the most closely watched US employment indicator on Friday Though all the data mentioned above are critical and will have a bearing on the stock market data related to non-farm payroll report will be crucial as it can lead to sharp swings in the stock markets especially if the data fails to meet market expectations That s because analysts are now linking these numbers with the chances of a recession in the US economy It is expected that roughly 70 000 new jobs were added in December compared to 94 000 in November This dip is already discounted by the markets but any further drop could create ripples in the markets However any positive surprises could trigger a fresh round of buying as the new year s allocations will also find their way into the markets So one needs to keep an eagle eye on US data this week to get an insight into broader trends on bourses (Also see Page 20)

WTC owner to pay millions in fines Foundations for two of five planned skyscrapers at the site were not excavated by today Article tools NEW YORK - The World Trade Center site s owner will pay millions in fines for falling at least a month behind on a deadline to turn over part of the site to a private developer building office towers there The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will pay between $9 million and $13 5 million to Larry Silverstein for failing to excavate foundations for two of five planned skyscrapers at the site by today its director said Monday The Port Authority set the deadline and $300 000-a-day penalties if it didn t deliver the land on time in a contentious renegotiation of Silverstein s lease in 2006 that officials said would help speed up long-stalled development at the 16-acre site The agency s executive director Anthony Shorris said Monday that contractors worked 20-hour-a-day schedules for months and have removed 300 000 tons of material enough to fill Giants Stadium but could not finish by the deadline "They were ambitious goals We did our best to meet them " Shorris said "This is an enormous project I wished we d be right on schedule " Shorris said the land would be completely excavated in four to six weeks The job s contractor is losing a $10 million bonus it was promised if it met today s deadline Shorris said Silverstein s company hired a contractor in November to build the two towers foundations and said it will make other preparations to be able to start building as soon as the Port Authority turns over the land "We appreciate how much the Port Authority has accomplished this year and a few extra weeks to complete everything is a minor bump in the road in the context of this entire project " said Janno Lieber who oversees the trade center project for Silverstein Silverstein who leased the trade center complex six weeks before 9/11 gave up rights to the Port Authority to build two of the five planned office towers at ground zero More articles Want more Get home delivery now Copyright 2008 Newport News Va Daily Press

[Lest we forget 15 Saudis brought down the World Trade Center I cringe as I recall our visit to the top with our young kids One could see the Statue of Liberty and many other things from up there Amazing then then that Bush wants toward them with a $15 billion military handout which we shall probably have to pay for by borrowing Saudi money garnered with their incredible oil profits While we are at it they are reported to have have been supporting the insurgent Sunnis too And if Bush plans to attack Iran will someone remind him that their population is 3 times that of Iraq and they can readily block all the oil issuing from Arabia Iraq and Iran with a few well placed torpedoes every now and then from their shores Ed Kent] http://www jpost com/servlet/Satellite

for this article: 18 Amid Israeli security concerns and in an apparent effort by US President George W Bush to go to Riyadh next week bearing gifts the Bush administration has moved up by a day the date on which it will formally notify Congress of plans for a $20 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia The Jerusalem Post has learned Although the administration had originally planned to inform Congress of the deal on January 15 it will now do so on January 14 Bush according to officials familiar with the issue will be in Saudi Arabia on the 15th and wants to be able to tell the Saudis he is pushing the issue and working for its passage After receiving formal notification of the proposed arms deal including details of what the package includes Congress will have 30 days to disapprove If it does not do so the plan will go through Israel has expressed concern over inclusion in the deal of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMS) commonly referred to as smart bombs Nevertheless it has not actively fought the sale The Post has also learned that Israel s defense establishment has expressed interest in receiving two new advanced models of the JDAM in order to retain its qualitative edge over the Saudis who would receive the standard smart bomb kit One of the models Israel is interested in has a laser-guided system and the other is protected from electronic-warfare systems and jamming Both are manufactured by Boeing Co in the US A joint resolution opposed to the sale has already been drafted in the House and attracted 35 co-sponsors Likewise some 235 congressmen have signed letters saying they would opposed the sale unless there were guarantees that the JDAMS would not be used against US troops or Israel Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) Photo: US Air Force The Bush administration has said that it viewed the sale as necessary to counteract Iran s increasing military threat Notification of the sale now fits in well with what Bush himself has said is a major theme of his trip to the region: assuring US allies of Washington s commitment to facing down Iran In addition to visiting Israel and the Palestinian Authority Bush will also go to Bahrain Kuwait Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates and Egypt State Department notification to Congress of the sale was already delayed once in December because some House members wanted more time to study the plan One Israeli official said it was interesting that Bush felt the need to go to Saudi Arabia bringing gifts while here both Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas felt the need to give Bush a present in terms of an agreement to commence talks on core issues of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict While Israeli officials could not confirm that the arms sale would be raised during Olmert s talks with Bush it has been a point of consternation in Israel Due to these concerns Israel and the US have engaged in a number of high-level discussions in recent months over what military platforms Washington could provide Israel in exchange for Israel lowering its objection to the deal In June OC IDF Planning Maj -Gen Ido Nehushtan and head of the MOD s Diplomatic-Security Bureau Amos Gilad traveled to Washington for talks at the Pentagon during which their request to purchase the F-22 stealth bomber was rejected In response the IDF has asked for the newly-developed advanced JDAM models A war is just if there is no alternative and the resort to arms is legitimate if they represent your last hope (Livy cited by Machiavelli) Ed Kent 212-665-8535

Six British civilians as well as 18 soldiers working in Afghanistan or Iraq may have been exposed to contaminated blood provided by the US military The British soldiers who were seriously wounded are now undergoing tests after it emerged that the Americans did not follow their own procedures and test the donors after they gave the blood The Health Protection Agency said the GPs of all six affected civilians had been informed But it admitted that because of the holiday period some of the GPs may not yet have informed their patients Those affected are being offered testing and counselling An HPA spokeswoman said: "The Health Protection Agency is aware that a small number of British individuals may have received a transfusion of unscreened blood as a result of life-threatening injuries received in Afghanistan or Iraq "The agency has advised the Ministry of Defence on the level of risk to those who may have been potentially exposed to infections as appropriate and is assisting with contacting some of the affected people " Story continues ADVERTISEMENT Haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after receiving contaminated blood in the late 1970s and 1980s described the blunder as an "absolute disgrace" Robert Mackie said it was "outrageous" that servicemen and women who risked their lives for their country had been put in this position He said: "Attitudes have not changed it is as simple as that Lessons have not been learnt It s an absolute disgrace to say the least " Defence Minister Derek Twigg said the 18 soldiers would "almost certainly" have died if they had not received an emergency blood transfusion at the front line While the risk of infection is "low" the matter is being taken "extremely seriously" he said The US Department of Defence said the American donors who provided the blood had now all tested negative for hepatitis and HIV But the British soldiers are still facing an agonising wait to learn the results of their own tests for blood infections Prime Minister Gordon Brown s spokesman said: "Of course this is a very serious matter and the Ministry of Defence are taking it very seriously "

KEVIN SCHOFIELD and GERRY BRAIDEN It will have to be a performance worthy of the best of Scottish sport Today s announcement at Holyrood by Sports Minister Stewart Maxwell must accomplish several tricky objectives at the same time all while he remains standing How to solve the problem of sportscotland has dogged the SNP since its election triumph of last May on the back of a manifesto pledge to abolish the agency as part of its drive to reduce public sector waste Unfortunately the agency s planned move to Glasgow was a symbolically important part of the city s winning bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games when much was made of the cross-party harmony achieved by Alex Salmond and Steven Purcell the Labour leader of Glasgow City Council advertisement Delaying the move of sportscotland s HQ from the Gyle outside Edinburgh to Dalmarnock in Glasgow s east end would not be fatally damaging to the 2014 event but would give Labour MSPs ammunition to attack the SNP Separately Mr Maxwell may have to press ahead with abolition and run the risk of parliamentary defeat by Labour the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats They voted 81-44 in favour of retaining sportscotland last month Alternatively Mr Maxwell can find a compromise that leaves him and the First Minister open to another charge of breaking an election pledge The first eight months of the SNP administration have been punctuated by the opposition claiming it is rowing back on issues such as police numbers and class sizes Frank McAveety Labour s sport spokesman yesterday said opposition parties had forced the government into a climb "I m delighted that they ve had to concede on the issue because it was always a daft idea in the first place The real priority is for the government to work with the sports agency to deliver a sporting future for Scotland s children " Former Sports Minister Patricia Ferguson Labour MSP for Glasgow Maryhill said: "If they are reversing their position I hope the consequences have been taken into account and that it s not a back-of-a-fag packet compromise to get it out the way "I would be very disappointed if the relocation didn t happen because there s an opportunity to do something very special at the national arena " Ross Finnie LibDem spokesman for health and wellbeing said: "It would be acceptable to make improvements to sportscotland s delivery It would not be acceptable for the name sportscotland to remain but for it to be stripped of its functions " The manifesto "We will abolish sportscotland and establish the three national centres currently run by sportscotland as not-for-profit trusts " "We will task the Scottish Institute of Sport with the primary responsibility for the elite athlete programme " Sporting chances Sportscotland is the national agency for sport in Scotland employing 140 staff aimed at increasing participation and improving performance in all sports It has three national centres: at Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore; in Largs; and on Cumbrae Sportscotland is the parent of the Scottish Institute of Sport which was launched in 1998 and has 70 staff It provides performance planning expertise and specific training programmes for athletes from a range of sports and has assisted in the early development of competitors such as tennis star Andy Murray

Newcastle chairman Chris Mort has insisted the club are not looking for a replacement for manager Sam Allardyce The former Bolton boss has endured an intensely difficult Christmas period which has seen his side take just one Barclays Premier League point from a possible nine and summer signing Joey Barton remanded in custody on charges of common assault and affray But amid fevered speculation that his employers could be looking for a new saviour - departed Tottenham manager Martin Jol and Geordie hero Alan Shearer occupied many column inches over the weekend - Mort has dismissed the rumours He said: "All this makes me laugh and I find all this speculation tedious "There is a different name every week and there is just no truth in it " Club owner Mike Ashley was among the travelling fans at Wigan on Boxing Day when he will have been left in little doubt over their feelings as the Magpies slipped to a dismal 1-0 defeat three days after needing a late equaliser to claim a point against relegation favourites Derby on their own park He was not at Stamford Bridge on Saturday as a much-improved display against an admittedly weakened Blues outfit failed to yield any reward albeit courtesy of a poor decision which allowed Salomon Kalou s late winner to stand However with Ashley enjoying a winter break Mort was there to hear the 3 000 or so away supporters applaud their side warmly from the pitch despite their disappointment He said: "We were all very proud of the players and disappointed that we lost to what was clearly an offside goal " Mort s reassurances may do little to quell the speculation - the bookmakers have Allardyce as on odds-on favourite to be out of his job before the end of the season and to be the next top flight boss to go The big test will come on Tuesday night when the Magpies entertain Manchester City at St James Park looking to end a run of three games without a victory to set themselves up for Sunday s tricky FA Cup third round trip to Stoke Medical staff are assessing striker Alan Smith after he spent Saturday night in a Tyneside hospital suffering from concussion after a clash of heads with team-mate Abdoulaye Faye Allardyce is currently preparing to try to strengthen his squad on limited resources during the winter transfer window and his need is growing all the time England striker Michael Owen returned from his thigh injury as a substitute at Chelsea but the man he replaced Obafemi Martins is due to head off on African Nations Cup duty with Nigeria after tomorrow s game and will be followed by Senegal duo Faye and Habib Beye as well as Cameroon midfielder Geremi With Nicky Butt facing a two-match ban for his next booking - he collected his ninth of the season for his protests over Kalou s strike - the manager s options could be severely restricted in the weeks ahead

A New York City tourist attraction the carriage horses lined up at Central Park may soon become a thing of the past if the City Council adopts a proposal to ban it as a tradition cruel to animals Council member Tony Avella a Democrat introduced the bill in mid-December and Council President Christine Quinn has yet to include it on the board s agenda on an unspecified date said Avella s press office The Horse and Carriage Association of New York representing carriage horse owners has the support of Mayor Michael Bloomberg who considers the quaint transport an integral part of the Big Apple s tourist appeal All decked out in plastic flowers for the New Year festivities some 70 carriage horses do a brisk trade as they parade non-stop up and down the streets of the city "I cannot talk I m going to reach 15 rides today it s a record " said a young Turkish coachwoman who came to the United States four years ago "Tourists give good tips we make good days " she added as she led her horse to a drinking trough while a Mexican moved his horse up behind her Carriage horses are among the city s most popular tourist attractions along with sidewalk artists and double-decker bus tours The rides cost 30-40 dollars (20- 30 euros) warm blankets are provided and convertible tops keep business thriving even if it rains After simmering for years the controversy resurfaced in September when a horse spooked by the loud drumming of a break-dancing group bolted and hit a tree injuring itself so badly it had to be put down Avella who tried to have the carriages restricted to Central Park in a 2005 measure that never took off relaunched his cause this time with the support of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) "As the primary enforcer of New York City s carriage horse laws the ASPCA can no longer accept the status quo " said the society s president Ed Sayres "Increased accidents the recent death of a carriage horse and the city comptroller s report all underscore the urgency to get these horses off the streets " Harking back to quieter days the horse and carriage has fallen victim to real estate speculation that has seen its historical stables on Manhattan s Upper West Side close down turned into garages or lavishly renovated into historical monuments The remaining stables are cramped and the long daily rides through legendary New York traffic jams pose a danger to the animals and a source of annoyance to motorists "You don t abolish taxis when people die in the traffic " complained carriage driver Henry from New Jersey "We have a very good security standard we make one million rides a year accidents can occur but they are extremely rare " he added Sensing the changing times small business groups in the city have launched a promising human-powered mode of transport in Manhattan: bicycle rickshaws

HORNETS SNUB FULHAM S KING BID E-mail Article Print-Friendly Subscribe to RSS Feed Post to del icio us Facebook Click here to bet on football with Sky Bet!Click here for our special Transfer Centre!Click here for more football headlines!Click here for football Text Alerts! Watford have rejected a bid of 4million from Fulham for star striker Marlon King King who signed a new contract with the Hornets in the summer is the club s top scorer this season with 11 goals and has been a vital part of Adrian Boothroyd s side since he joined the club at the end of 2005 Chief executive Mark Ashton told the club s official website: "Fulham have made a bid for Marlon King "We have stated our position on Marlon; he is our leading goalscorer and one of the spearheads of our team "We have no need to sell him and neither do we want to " The bid could be one of many from the Cottagers this month with Mohamed Al Fayed undeterred by the prospect of paying large sums for the right players New boss Roy Hodgson insistshis chairman is prepared to dip into his personal fortune to recruit the reinforcements needed to stay up And Hodgson claims "persuasive" Harrods owner Al Fayed will pay what it takes to keep Fulham out of the Coca-Cola Championship "The chairman is very supportive He wants the club to stay in the Premiership " he said "He s spent a lot of money already and one can t be expected to spend limitless sums of money on a football club even if they are wealthy "But Mr Al Fayed has spent the money because of his love of the club and he will do so again "We re trying to be reasonably realistic in setting our targets for the transfer window I m sure that if we succeed in being able to attract those targets the chairman won t stand in the way of getting them "He will not be saying it s a good idea to sign that player but I m not making the funds available The chairman is anxious that we do as much as we can to put things right "We don t have a limitation in that we can only spend a certain amount of money or sign a certain number of players It s up to our judgement " Hodgson has created profiles of the players he wants and having identified the right targets managing director David McNally takes over the negotiations Nationality is not an issue for Hodgson - his predecessor Lawrie Sanchez insisted on signing British players or overseas imports with experience of English football - but height will be a telling factor "The imbalance in the team comes from the lack of size A lot of our players are of a similar size and not very big so stature will be a factor for us " he said "But if we are to buy new players they must be quality who will make us a better team not just make us bigger " Al Fayed convinced Hodgson to take the Fulham job and the 60-year-old former Inter Milan coach hopes he will be equally successful in luring the players he wants to Craven Cottage "Mr Al Fayed is a very persuasive man He s not an easy man to turn down when he s decided he wants something " he said "I don t regret my decision to come here and if I identified a player who had some doubts about joining Fulham I d be working hard to persuade him this is a great place to be "We re working hard to become a better team and we have a bright future as long as we can stay in the Premiership "

Watch video of the speedboat incident When the White House announced that President Bush would travel to the Middle East this week to bolster support among America s vulnerable Arab allies in the Gulf there was always the risk that militants in the Iranian regime would feel forced to respond In Tehran the Gulf is known as the Persian Gulf and nothing could be calculated to upset the regime more than Mr Bush s unprecedented five-day procession through the oil-rich region where America maintains 40 000 troops besides the forces deployed in Iraq From Friday the US leader will work his way down the Gulf states starting in Kuwait and travelling to Bahrain Abu Dhabi Dubai and Saudi Arabia Overhead US fighters will be stepping up patrols to protect Air Force One while below the warships of the US Fifth Fleet will be ready to respond to any Iranian moves For this reason commanders in the naval wing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) may have been ordered or encouraged to cause mischief in the Strait of Hormuz the narrow passageway at the entrance to the Gulf through which 25 per cent of the world s crude oil is shipped The IRGC is one of the most powerful institutions in Iran and one of its most celebrated former members is none other than President Ahmadinejad The force was responsible last year for the ambush and capture of 15 British sailors and Marines who were paraded on television and held for two weeks before being freed humiliated but unharmed The IRGC regards the Gulf waters as its own and feels that it has the right to patrol at will With Mr Bush expected to step up his rhetoric against Iran during his visit Tehran may have wanted to remind him and the world about the vulnerability of global energy supplies particularly with crude oil selling for $100 a barrel There is also the temptation to tweak the tail of the world s only superpower A year ago Mr Bush deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups in the Gulf and threatened to use force against Iran to prevent the country acquiring nuclear weapons Many in the region believed that confrontation was inevitable Now Mr Bush is weakened as his presidency enters its final year A US National Intelligence Estimate published last month revealed that Washington believes that Iran has suspended its atomic weapons programme The threat of the use of force against one of the origial axis of evil regimes has evaporated Domestic politics in Iran may also have played a part in the Hormuz incident The Iranian regime may have felt compelled to act in the increasingly tense political climate ahead of parliamentary elections in March where the ruling hardliners are facing a stiff challenge from more moderate forces The Iranian mission was carried out by five IRGC speed boats that swarmed a US Navy cruiser a destroyer and a frigate The confrontation was hardly an even match Each of the multimillion-dollar US warships could have destroyed the Iranian craft in seconds But that does not diminish the seriousness of the incident Ever since the USS Cole was rammed by an al-Qaeda suicide boat in Aden harbour in 2000 killing 17 US sailors US forces have been trained to use lethal force to prevent such attacks As many Iranians remember only too well accidents can happen in the crowded air and waterways of the Gulf In 1988 the USS Vincennes shot down an Iran Air passenger jet killing 290 people after mistaking the aircraft for an Iranian fighter-bomber After three decades of separation from the West Iranian motives and actions are never easy to interpret Sunday s incident is particularly curious because it came after a speech last week by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Iran s supreme leader who raised the possibility of one day restoring relations with the Great Satan as America is commonly known by the regime I would be the first one to support these relations Ayatollah Khamenei told students in the central Iranian province of Yazd Of course we never said the severed relations were for ever But he added that no one should expect any improvements soon For the time being it [restoring ties] is harmful and we should not pursue it Sunday s incident in the Gulf will serve to remind those running in the US presidential elections that for the next incumbent of the White House resolving the festering relations with Iran remains one of America s foreign policy priorities

Aston Villa staged a second-half revival to claim a 2-1 win that ended Wigan s resurgence under new boss Steve Bruce and sent the Latics crashing back into the Premier League relegation zone Titus Bramble s first goal for Wigan and his first for 16 months gave the home side a deserved half-time lead at the JJB Stadium in atrocious conditions But centre-back Curtis Davies starting his first league game for Villa initially hauled his side level in the 55th minute prior to Gabriel Agbonlahor netting the winner 15 minutes later John Carew hobbled off for Villa on 11 minutes after a challenge by Paul Scharner and was replaced by Luke Moore Marcus Bent and Antoine Sibierski squandered half chances for Wigan but the Latics went ahead in the 28th minute Story continues ADVERTISEMENT Olof Mellberg was initially brave in blocking at point-blank range a drive from Ryan Taylor that was destined for the top right-hand corner But from the ensuing corner delivered into the heart of the area by Taylor Bramble rose unchallenged to power a bullet-header past a helpless Scott Carson Villa drew level from a 55th-minute corner after Kevin Kilbane blocked a drive from Young Gareth Barry s inswinger found Davies who headed home from six yards Davies equaliser set the platform for Villa to then go on and win the game courtesy of Agbonlahor s seventh goal of the season Nigel Reo-Coker sprayed a raking pass into the left corner where Moore seized on the ball before finding Young Young then made his way to the deadball line and turned in a cross to the near post where Agbonlahor headed home off the underside of the crossbar past Kirkland to complete Villa s stirring comeback

Race Sex and the Battle for the Democratic Nod Race and gender are this week s central flash-points in the race for the Democratic nomination Here are some data from the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll to add to the mix Clinton s advantages in national polling which basically evaporated in the new poll relied on overwhelming support among women Now a week and a half before the South Carolina primary the new poll finds a gap emerging between white women and black women It s a divide that may prove critical: African Americans made up nearly half of the Palmetto state s Democratic primary voters in 2004; black women made up 29 percent A month ago both white and black women favored Clinton by wide margins but there s been a big shift While white women continue to favor Clinton (though by a diminished margin) black women have jumped to Obama now preferring the Illinois senator by 24 percentage points Notably the change is not a broad indictment of Clinton but an improved outlook on Obama Ninety percent of black women view Clinton favorably the same as for Obama But some of the shine is off: 57 percent have "strongly" positive views about Clinton down from 72 percent in early November Black women s greater support for Obama may also hinge on an enthusiasm gap While black women and white women are about equally likely to say they are more enthusiastic about Clinton s candidacy because of the historic possibility it offers (her being first female president) black women are twice as likely as white women to be so inspired by Obama s shot at being the nation s first African American president Here are the crosstabs among these key groups: Primary vote among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents: Clinton Obama Edwards All likely voters 42 37 11 Men 33 42 14 Women 47 36 8 Whites 41 33 14 African Americans 32 60 3 White men 31 38 18 White women 50 30 11 Black women 35 59 2 The Post-ABC national poll was conducted by telephone Jan 9-12 among a random national sample of 1 130 including additional interviews with randomly-selected African Americans for a total of 202 black respondents The margin of sampling error for the full poll is plus or minus three percentage points it is plus or minus 10 points for black women and plus or minus seven points for white women The poll s sample of black men was too small to report By Jennifer Agiesta | January 14 2008; 4:38 PM ET Post Polls Previous: Out on a High Note | Next: New Year New Low for Bush Posted by: Lucky Lakeshore | January 14 2008 06:24 PM Posted by: Suzanne | January 14 2008 07:05 PM Posted by: thecrisis | January 14 2008 07:12 PM Posted by: jim | January 14 2008 07:20 PM Posted by: jim | January 14 2008 07:23 PM Posted by: RetCombatVet | January 14 2008 07:29 PM Posted by: MadeleineFL | January 14 2008 07:41 PM Posted by: stat | January 14 2008 07:41 PM Posted by: Alex | January 14 2008 07:49 PM Posted by: AppeaseThis | January 14 2008 07:52 PM Posted by: Adjetey | January 14 2008 08:21 PM Posted by: K Nedd | January 14 2008 08:53 PM Posted by: Charlene | January 14 2008 09:00 PM Posted by: Jennifer Agiesta | January 14 2008 10:12 PM Posted by: Larry Blasko | January 14 2008 10:43 PM Posted by: akminstral | January 14 2008 11:04 PM Posted by: Emily | January 15 2008 06:13 PM Post a Comment

Me: How could you achieve something that was well-nigh impossible Everybody said Girish: (while shaking hands with journalists) Cost reduction ensuring quality standards and finally a car that was safe on the roads And yes a kind of performance that was demonstrable Me: But between the announcements made by Ratan Tata in 2005 and now input costs rose (had to repeat the question again natural ambience effect!) Girish: Costs can be reduced with a change in procurement tactics Internet auctions adhesives in place of costly welding size a rear engine (reduces length of engine compartment) all played a role Components from suppliers my team and continuous R&D made sure that it is a safe vehicle Me: What was your biggest challenge Girish: (pausing more a moment) The truck (Ace) was a different experience for me But Nano already had the price tag We had to virtually back-calculate We couldn t do anything to go through the target Packaging was also critical A bit of additional weight meant everything had to be done again Me: Do you think the low-cost Nano will help make Tata Motors more profitable Girish: Are you talking about margins I am not the right person to talk about that but the car is in front of you As Mr Tata said it s been created to cater to the needs of the family that was travelling on a scooter We think it has great potential Me: But everything was not as rosy for the company even five years ago What changed Girish: (After a conversation with a colleague who possibly told him to finish quickly) We were bleeding in 2000 Costs could be rationalised At a meeting Mr Kant told us to bring it down by 10 per cent We finally hit the right buttons As an organisation we changed rapidly Nano it s not just a new car but a new way of doing things Me: I won t detain you any longer Just a final question Any regrets on any aspect of the project Girish: None at all I had the best team to work with Leaders who were always there and a nascent desire to make one man s dream a reality Me: No concerns then Girish: (as he left) If I had we wouldn t have brought out the product It s completely safe and delivers on the promise: The 1 lakh car God was kind to me later that day It turned out during lunch that some auto component company executives were talking to Mr Wagh Suddenly the gloomy faces of the representatives of the auto component industry had vanished Singur can do 2 5 lakh now as far as capacity is concerned Another lakh might be added and so too can other manufacturing locations Didn t record this part but will let my readers trust my good memory anyway Me: Hi Girish hope I m not disturbing again Girish: No Please Me: Some say you guys just wanted to corner a share of the three-wheeler market Girish: (in a non-resentful way) It s okay People drive vehicles but a car is a much better option than a three-wheeler Everybody wants to make the small car India has potholes on city roads In many villages we don t even have roads Ace succeeded hugely because customers knew it was what they wanted With Nano four wheels can do the job of two Me: Steve Jobs may be angry with Tata Motors Nobody will talk about iPod nano in India Girish: (Laughing) That s a first Anyway we have applied for 34 patents for the powertrain design and once granted they will be for the Tata Nano Nano is small or the smallest It s 8 per cent smaller than the next bigger competitor! Everything has innovation written on it From windshield wipers rear engine layout spacious design fuelling system and tubeless tyres I believe Apple will be happy not sad I had to discontinue the conversation but it left an indelible mark on my mind What Americans Japanese and even the mighty Chinese couldn t do we Indians have While well-known activist Sunita Narain might be shouting from the rooftop about pollution and the environment Tata claims that Nano complies with Bharat Stage-III and even stringent Euro-IV emission benchmarks The Tata Group cannot build roads; that the government has to do Levy taxes for each use of the affordable car as author Tim Harford suggested in his 2005 book The Undercover Economist That your car s down payment is the full payment doesn t merely suggest low-cost but points to the way things are going to be done from now on It s a new world for manufacturers of not only cars but for everybody who can tie up resources smartly Consumer is the king finally More importantly the Nano way of empowering a younger generation to lead innovation could well be the new way for tired managements of aging companies to surge through in these fiercely competitive times Responses to Episode-173 on the issue: Should social networking sites be banned in office (Business Line January 7 2008) There is no use in blaming only social networking sites for eating away the productive time of employees To achieve the desired results employers should limit the Internet timings in their offices I have my own reservations about the social networking sites If you happened to meet your old friend or colleague through this network it is okay But most of the users of these social networking sites always look for strangers and try to make them friends I see them as virtual hypocrites as most of them try to avoid eye contact even with their neighbours but seriously look for friendship in the virtual world V Ramaswamy Noida There are many valid reasons for employees to use social networking sites at workplace The 80-20 rule holds well in almost all the offices 80 per cent of the effective workload is shared by 20 per cent of the employees A good number of senior managers delegate most of their jobs including the presentation part Middle level executives are locked into their office chairs for 12-16 hours and mostly it is seven days a week for them Their commuting time on average is about two hours per day The social animals therefore need more than coffee/lunch breaks viz: social networking and using of cell phone during office hours Organisations have to keep in mind the impact on 80 per cent of the work before questioning any individual on the usage of Office networks for personal breaks Krishnamoorthy Mangalore It is a fact that in majority of the offices Internet is being used for purposes beyond what is being required officially One is networking sites The other major villain is online trading The second issue poses a problem on weekdays during the market hours It is certainly diversion of precious resources of the organisations While a marginal amount of digression may help in removing the boredom of office it can be taken care of by certain HR initiatives Having Internet control and usage policy is the need of the day Krithivasan e-mail Two years back I had a chance to do a project in Dubai In that company access to the Net was absolutely unrestricted After a month s time their net bill shot up The reason was employees started downloading songs uploading videos etc Then the company had a meeting with employees and enhanced the downloadable capacity but advised the staff not to download large files The staff accepted the reason behind that and acted prudently Ramji Chennai Readers can mail me their comments suggestions and advice at swatilistening@gmail com Blog at: http://Swati-CA blogspot com More Stories on : Cars | Tata Motors Ltd | Internet | Swati CA Article E-Mail :: Comment :: Syndication :: Printer Friendly Page

Sean Collins Getting to grips with Obama-mania He has charisma a good physique and hip-mod grey suits and a policy programme that consists only of hope Barack Obama takes the politics of personality to a new low Printer-friendly version Email-a-friend Respond Barack Obama s surprise win over Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses created quite a buzz in the US: according to the pundits it was an earthquake a smashing victory ; a result that has shaken the political landscape (1) It wasn t so much the fact of the win by a comfortable margin (Clinton was rejected by more than 70 per cent of the voters) but how Obama seemed truly to engage with and enthuse voters as evidenced by the huge numbers at his rallies (helped by Oprah Winfrey no doubt but even the Oprah-less rallies were impressive) and a near-doubling of the turnout at the caucuses from previous years The nation woke up the next morning to watch his victory speech and many found it eloquent and moving The prospect of the world s superpower being led by the son of an African led many to believe that we were witnessing history at its inception At the time this article was published it appeared that Obama was about to win again this time in the New Hampshire primary with more than one poll showing him with a double-digit lead Of course the polls may not hold up but even if Clinton manages a win in New Hampshire Obama has become a force to be reckoned with You don t have to accept all of the talk about Obama being transformational and the second coming of JFK to recognise that there is palpable enthusiasm for Obama now This type of genuine excitement about a presidential candidate hasn t been seen in the US for a long time perhaps since the early days of Bill Clinton s candidacy in the early Nineties or as some would say not since Kennedy In today s generally post-ideological third way political environment this could be considered surprising: you might have expected more of a pragmatic managerial type to emerge someone dull like Britain s Gordon Brown Obama s rise certainly cannot be explained by his policies these are for the most part pedestrian and indistinguishable from his Democratic Party opponents stances His popularity is certainly helped by the fact that he is an exceptional orator his post-Iowa speech is definitely must-see viewing (2) However his public performances are uneven; in particular he often doesn t do that well in the cut and thrust of debates including the most recent one in New Hampshire last Saturday night To get closer to explaining the Obama phenomenon we need to look beyond the man himself and consider the broader political context In particular there are two trends in politics today that are especially relevant: the desire to move beyond partisanship and the demise of party-led politics and the concomitant rise of individual freelancing candidates Politics in the US (and elsewhere in the West) has for some time now been empty of ideological conflict: the old left-right divide over principles of how to run society has disappeared despite advocates on both sides attempting to prop it up through heated exchanges Instead politics has become more of a badge of personal identity This was especially true during the last presidential election when blue-staters (Democrats) and red-staters (Republicans) defined themselves against one another in cultural terms The fact that politics has become reduced to personal matters explains its intensity and vituperative nature but also its hollowness Over time the squabbling partisans have boiled down to a hard core (3) The general public has become weary of the dumbed-down Punch-and-Judy battlers on TV like Bill O Reilly and Keith Olberman Ann Coulter and Michael Moore among others And the anti-partisan mood is not just a view among the turned-off masses it is shared by many elites including Washington-based pundits For instance Los Angeles Times reporter Ronald Brownstein argues that the biggest problem facing American politics is the paralysis caused by excessive partisanship a view held by many (4) This desire to overcome partisanship is really apolitical in nature It is an attack on the concept of having and fighting for political interests And this desire is what Obama keys into Rather than detail programmatic changes (the what ) Obama emphasises modes of operating (the how ) He talks about working together and overcoming partisan gridlocks it s not so much political ends but means He has from the start of his campaigned stressed the importance of a respectful tone (5) He is anti-ideological and in his implicit endorsement of economic and social fundamentals essentially conservative which explains why he is able to gain noticeable support from Republicans and independents as well as Democrats As Andrew Sullivan perceptively pointed out in his profile of Obama before the Iowa result Obama embodies the sentiment to escape the past and to transcend the culture wars (6) This has very little to do with Obama s specific policies but rather who he is Supporters seem to prefer to live in the realm of Obama s lofty rhetoric rather than examine his views He is more of a blank slate on to which people project their desires When the spotlight occasionally falls on his specific ideas he runs into trouble such as his derided idea of invading Pakistan to find Osama bin Laden This emphasis on who Obama is may be the ultimate victory of identity politics not in the sense of identity politics as bickering among tribes (indeed it is notable that Obama rarely refers to his race and has clearly separated himself from black politicos) but identity as the defining feature of political advantage In this regard it was noteworthy that after gaining public attention from a keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Party National Convention Obama decided to enter national politics by first describing his personal history in a memoir before he had achieved much of anything in politics (7) It is the ephemeral nature of Obama s candidacy and his support that has made it so hard for Hillary Clinton to oppose him She criticises his lack of experience but his supposedly unsullied past is what many find appealing Obama seems to rise above it all he s the untouchable Saint Barack Commentators are on the lookout for any sign of nasty tricks or slander from the Clinton campaign The slightest misstep such as when Clinton s advisers suggested that Obama s over-ambition was evidenced by a kindergarten essay is seized upon and backfires on her (Obama finds it easy to dismiss such attempts with humour; landing in New Hampshire he quipped: It s just like I imagined it when I was talking to my kindergarten teacher ) The demise of the Democratic Party apparatus is another important contributing factor This is a long-term trend but President Bill Clinton took a big step towards deconstructing it Many have highlighted how via being at the helm of the Democratic Leadership Council President Clinton took the party in a centrist direction triangulating and seemingly co-opting Republican positions But fewer recognise how this move dismantled traditional intermediaries within the party and further distanced the party leadership from any connection with its base Following the end of President Clinton s two terms in office and the disarray following Al Gore s defeat in the 2000 election the Clintons were able to take control of what remained of the party structure They set out on a plan of putting Hillary in a position to be the party s candidate a project initiated when she was handpicked in 2000 to run for a shoo-in Senate seat in New York a state she had no prior connection with (unlike in the UK it is rare for US candidates to be placed in geographical constituencies where they have no established foothold) Hillary s selection by what remained of the party s bureaucracy appeared to be working she definitely had a high public recognition factor and popularity among Democrats and she steadily built up a track record in Congress Prior to Iowa all the pundits talked about what a strong candidate she was But in reality she has always been a uncertain foundation on which to build Democrat hopes People can easily see through her claims to 35 years of experience they know that most of these were spent as a private-sector lawyer and presidential spouse (As Obama put it she wasn t exactly treasury secretary in the Clinton administration ) And in today s anti-partisan climate she has the particular problem of appearing polarising indeed she is a political Rorschach test generating strong feelings of being both hated and loved And opinions don t fall neatly along party lines: a ferocious anti-Hillary sentiment is expressed by both conservatives (who go on about her radical Sixties past) and liberals (who won t forgive her for voting for the Iraq war) By historical standards Hillary and all of the other candidates are weak and it s only in this general context that a political neophyte like Obama can stand out There is a real irony here in how the political world Bill Clinton helped to create is coming back to bite his wife s campaign Bill s poll-based views his parsing of the truth contributed to greater cynicism about politicians Hillary s candidacy harks back to those days a bridge back to the twentieth century to subvert her husband s catchphrase Obama picks up and uses this As his campaign director David Axelrod says the public don t want calculation and parsing (8) Obama is now out-Clintoning (Bill) Clinton emphasising the same themes of hope and uniting America that Clinton put forward in 1992 The difference is that this time Obama s is even more devoid of content Indeed it is remarkable and a testament to the low expectations of today that an essentially mundane message around working together in Washington can be seen as the successor to Martin Luther King s I Have a Dream speech Bill Clinton s rise also signified the elevation of individual personality above the party and its base This has continued to Hillary s detriment Bill s therapeutic I feel your pain approach to connecting with the public now leads to viewing Hillary as cold and remote If the contest is reduced to one of personality Obama does win hands-down over the wooden Hillary As Maureen Dowd put it voters are dreaming that Obama will be a cool smart elegant reasonable literary witty decent West Wing sort of president (9) All of the emphasis on Obama s charisma his physique hip-mod grey suits takes the discussion of politicians as individual personalities to an all-time low It would be wise to be cautious about all of the current Obama-mania The media has just about awarded Obama the nomination seeing him as invincible (10) But this is the same media that a few weeks ago dismissed Obama as too lightweight Even if Hillary loses in New Hampshire she has the resources to continue to fight on All of the candidates lack of foundation in a classic base of support via a true political party gives the race the possibility of real instability In some regards Obama has benefited from the focus on one-time frontrunner Hillary You can easily imagine that once attention really turns to Obama his lack of substance and his weak debating style could give way to disappointment and criticism But the unique and paradoxical thing about Obama is that he has somehow turned apoliticism into a rallying cry that resonates with the public and this may in defiance of historical precedence give him

Bulls Jones pursue talks 28/12/2007 11:27 -&nbsp(SA) Ludeke: Jones put out feelers Bulls chasing Eddie Jones White backs Coetzee as coach Johannesburg - The Bulls negotiations to secure the part-time services of Eddie Jones the former Australian World Cup coach who played a significant part in the Springboks 2007 World Cup success could be finalised as early as Thursday next week Jones currently coaches Saracens in the English Premiership and the Heineken Cup competitions He also assisted Jake White in preparing the Springbok team before and during the World Cup in France It was originally hoped the negotiations would have been finalised with Jones and the Saracens during the week preceding Christmas However CEO of the Blue Bulls Company Barend van Graan said negotiations were put on hold as Jones had left for Japan on rugby matters It nevertheless seems a foregone conclusion that the Bulls will obtain the services of Jones to from time to time assist new Bulls coach Frans Ludeke with the backline It will undoubtedly help to alleviate the void that was left with the departure of Australian Todd Louden who was in charge of the backs for the past few years at the Bulls Next week s negotiations with Saracens and Jones will probably focus on the dates on which Jones can be released by the English club to assist the Bulls in Pretoria It is ironic that Jones coached the Reds against the Bulls in this year s Super 14 competition when the Bulls beat the Queenslanders by a Super record winning margin of 92-3 to ensure a place in the semi-final of the Super 14 series The Bulls went on to win the Super 14 competition by beating the Sharks in the final with that famous last-gasp Bryan Habana try well after the hooter had sounded News24 is now available on your cellphone Click here to get News24 headlines on your Facebook profile

(File Photo Starbucks Corp on Monday said Founder and Chairman Howard Schultz will immediately take back the chief executive post from Jim Donald ) Photo Gallery>>> BEIJING Jan 8 (Xinhuanet) -- Starbucks Corp on Monday said Founder and Chairman Howard Schultz will immediately take back the helm from Jim Donald as the chief executive a move aimed at a radical overhaul of its business to tackle flagging sales at its 10 500 American stores The announcement comes as shares have plummeted from nearly 40 U S dolloars a share at the end of 2006 to below 20 dollars a share after more than a decade of nearly continual growth Schultz said that a slowing economy and rising dairy prices have contributed to Starbucks problems but the bigger problem is the company itself as it s been expanding too quickly losing focus on customer relations Schultz said he would refocus on the customer experience and make sure that "Starbucks experience" is markedly different from rivals like McDonald s and Dunkin Donuts that have lured customers with lattes and premium coffee To improve sales performance Schultz said he would slow the pace of U S store expansion close stores that are underperforming imporve the performance at existing locations by "re-igniting the emotional attachment with customers " At the same time he plans to speed up expansion outside the United States while increasing the profitability of those stores Starbucks increasingly broad customer base includes blue-collar shoppers who are viewed as more vulnerable to a possible U S recession Meanwhile chains such as Dunkin Donuts and McDonald s are moving into Starbucks territory with cut-price rival products (Agencies)

------------------------------------------------------------
Video extract The UK government has condemned a videotape issued by the kidnappers of five British men held captive in Iraq A Foreign Office spokesman said the tape would "add to the distress of the men s families and friends" In the film dated 18 November the kidnappers say they will kill one of the men as a "first warning" unless UK forces leave Iraq within 10 days The five men were seized on 29 May from Baghdad s finance ministry building by gunmen disguised as police officers They are being held by a militia group calling itself the Islamic Shia Resistance in Iraq No matter what the cause hostage-taking can never be justified Foreign Office spokesman The tape which the Foreign Office is studying is in Arabic and was broadcast on Al-Arabiya television on Tuesday The Britons - four guards and a computer expert - were initially taken to a Shia suburb after being seized Consular officials had remained in regular contact with the families of the men the spokesman added The case has not featured in the media as much as other kidnappings in Iraq - including those of Ken Bigley and Margaret Hassan - because of a Foreign Office request for minimal coverage That request was made in keeping with the wishes of the men s families The Foreign Office says it does not want anything to get in the way of its negotiations through third parties to get the men released Withdraw thieves In the tape filmed in front of an "Islamic Shia Resistance in Iraq" flag one of the men gives his name says he has been held for 173 days and adds: "I feel we have been forgotten " In written text shown on the video the kidnappers say the UK should "withdraw all the thieves and the gangs that they have brought with them to plunder and squander our wealth and resources and to return what they have stolen" They warn that if the UK does not meet its demands "this hostage will be executed on day number 10 as a first warning then other details that you will not like will be made public" It is unclear whether the 10-day deadline begins now or when the recording was made The Foreign Office spokesman said: "No matter what the cause hostage-taking can never be justified "We again call on those holding the men to release them unconditionally " Prime Minister Gordon Brown s spokesman also condemned the release of the videotape "It s our long-established policy not to comment on such footage and we encourage others not to speculate " he added "That would be unhelpful and distressing to the families concerned " Ordinary men BBC special correspondent Gavin Hewitt said a crucial difference between this kidnapping and previous cases had been that intelligence agencies believed the Britons were being held by a splinter group of the Mahdi army - a Shia militia - rather than Sunnis linked to al-Qaeda But the "secretive cell" did not appear to be part of a big organisation BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said which made it more difficult for British authorities to understand its motives However our correspondent said going public with the tape signalled a change of behaviour in the kidnappers as up until now nothing had been heard from the five men being held We miss them so much and want them to come home to us so that our families can be complete again and our children no longer have to endure the pain of missing their fathers Earlier statement from families It was putting "immense pressure" on the British government to resolve the issue but little was yet known about the hostages whereabouts and how serious the group s threats were he added In September the families of the five men urged their captors to end their "torment" of being separated from "ordinary family men" The statement continued: "They are sons fathers and brothers who were working to support us - their families "We miss them so much and want them to come home to us so that our families can be complete again and our children no longer have to endure the pain of missing their fathers "

Kerry endorses Obama By Evan Lehmann Eagle Washington Bureau Article Last Updated: 01/11/2008 09:53:03 AM EST Friday January 11 WASHINGTON Sen Barack Obama D-Ill captured a weighty endorsement yesterday from former presidential nominee Sen John F Kerry D-Mass elevating his presidential campaign that s locked in a virtual tie with Sen Hillary Rodham Clinton D-N Y as they speed toward a raft of primary contests Kerry could bring some muscle to Obama s team if he campaigns vigorously and is able to tap the deep well of supporters he developed while capturing the Democratic nomination in 2004 according to campaign experts Massachusetts junior senator immediately used his presence to attack Clinton portraying her warning last week that Obama is promising "false hopes" as uninspiring rhetoric that undervalues the potential of American citizens "My friends the only charge that rings false is the one that tells you not to hope for a better tomorrow Don t let anyone tell you to accept the downsizing of the American Dream " Kerry said at an Obama rally in Charleston S C a key primary state "The old guard sometimes has a hard time acknowledging an individual who breaks the mold " he said "Well let me tell you something Barack Obama isn t just going to break Advertisement the mold together we are going to shatter into a million pieces " Kerry s endorsement is considered by some as second in value to only former Vice President Al Gore s and perhaps that of Sen Edward M Kennedy D-Mass But it could have little effect if Kerry fails to mobilize his former supporters composed of some 3 million people to volunteer for Obama "If in fact John will take that email list and mobilize those folks and convince them that Obama s the guy for the job and then begin to recruit them into the field organization and as contributors that s significant " said former Massachusetts Gov Michael Dukakis who won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 but lost in the general election "But mere endorsements as we ve seen don t do a hell of a lot " Kerry will be speaking in Pittsfield tonight at 6:30 at Spice restaurant in an event sponsored by the Berkshire Brigades and state Sen Benjamin B Downing Tickets are $25

He s such a great cook and such a brilliant publicist Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall that the two parts of his life are now blended into a slightly unnerving sauce which leaves you anxiously counting your hand whisks Tonight on Channel 4 he sets out to turn his home town of Axminster into the free-range chicken equivalent of the town down the road plastic-bag-free Modbury Obviously this is a good thing If you are going to eat meat you owe it to the creature concerned as well as to your taste buds to make sure its life short though it may be (39 days to rear a hen in industrial conditions) is a happy one That s happy in the sense of an absence of pain rather than an attempt to anthromorphise a hen s experience of life Happy hens are delightful creatures keeping up a low harmonious susurration of contentment when allowed to take their own route from slug to seed head to nesting box or the bonnet of your car if it s warmer However maintaining the national flock in such conditions apart from exposing them and us to bird flu and the constant depredations of foxes rats badgers etc would be very expensive and probably require most people to move to somewhere more spacious - Vietnam say - where much of our cheap fowl flesh is reared in conditions far removed from those in which the bird originally evolved (You will remember that south Vietnam was once known as Cochin China and that there is a fine breed of hen still the Cochin distant ancestor of the battery bird ) Hugh F-W s charm and determination may well conquer the good folk of Axminster a reasonably prosperous small market town very like Modbury in its make up At least it will until the next time they re desperate for a curry after a night in the tavern or a fried chicken for the family after an exhausting day out Cracking the cheap bird the "two for 5" offers in supermarkets looks easy compared with taking the cheap bird out of the ready meals and takeaways and restaurants everywhere Saying that the task is insuperable is no reason for not starting out on it But it is as well to be aware of the real costs of an hour-long TV programme Victory in Axminster would give lift-off to the RSPCA s new campaign to outlaw industrial chicken rearing Soon the government would respond with a ban But we ve been here before with another worthwhile project Banning the hideous practice of rearing calves in crates so they could be sold as milk-reared veal was a triumph which sadly led only to the export of the practice across the North Sea The same thing happened with pig production: more than 70% of pork eaten in Britain is reared in conditions that would be illegal here Last week the government released a fascinating analysis of our eating and spending habits (pdf) We re mostly eating healthier food more fruit and veg and so on and we import more and more of it - although the report does not trouble to explain that this is because cheap food is often less ethical food As we grow richer we re spending a smaller proportion of our income on what we eat while becoming more interested in its source - except the poorest two-fifths of the population who still spend nearly 20% of their income on food and don t have the luxury of insisting on organic The only answer that would allow them to keep eating chicken and chicken that had lived a short but contented life is to make them richer Now there s a thought del icio us | Digg it | Tailrank | Reddit | Newsvine | Now Public | Technorati This entry was tagged with the following keywords: organic health food

Home woes for Flyers PHILADELPHIA -- With Thursday night s win against the Toronto Maple Leafs the Flyers improved to 14-9-4 when Mike Richards records at least one point if only the Flyers could be as consistent as their $69-million future-captain when it comes to playing at the Wachovia Centre After beginning the 2007-08 season with six straight home wins the Flyers went 0-3-2 and 0-2-2 with one win sandwiched in-between Richards meanwhile has tallied at least one point in each of the last 16 home games for the Flyers (10G 16A) including his assist on Joffrey Lupul s third period goal in last night s 4-1 win over the Leafs that tied a Flyers team record for consecutive point-scoring at home It hasn t helped them necessarily in the win column but the Flyers powerplay units are on fire With Lupul s second period marker the Flyers have scored at least one powerplay goal in each of their last nine games (15 for 57 26 3%) and are ranked second in the NHL ----- Right or wrong expect Flyer netminders to start feeling some heat if the team can t shake the inconsistency that has plagued them since the end of October Martin Biron s win last night snapped a four-game winless streak (0-2-2) and was only his second win in his last eight games In years past there was always a viable alternative at the end of the bench This year backup Antero Niittymaki is an unspectacular 3-4-0 with a 901 save-percentage and third-stringer Brian Boucher is on a one-way deal with the AHL s Philadelphia Phantoms and is subject to recall waivers One option: General Manager Paul Holmgren might look to get a goaltender when he thins out the team s abundance of defencemen after the holiday trade-freeze which ended at 12:01 a m on Dec 28 ----- How nice would Patrick Sharp s 19 goals and 32 points look on the Flyers roster right now Sharp fell out of favour with then-head coach Ken Hitchcock and was dispatched to the Blackhawks in December 2005 The Flyers received Matt Ellison (who tallied one point in seven career games with the Flyers) along with a third-round draft pick for Sharp who now leads the NHL with nine shorthanded points (7G 2A) and is among the league s top goal scorers ----- And last but not least the Flyers took a huge step towards shedding the head-hunting label that rightly or wrongly has been affixed to the Orange and Black when they traded Ben Eager to the Chicago Blackhawks on Dec 18 Eager a poster-child for questionably illegal potshots since his days with the Oshawa Generals of the OHL contributed little to the Flyers this season His parting contribution as a member of the Flyers reached a new low on Dec 11 when he loitered around the Pittsburgh dressing room to taunt head coach Michel Therrien following the Flyers 8-2 thrashing of the Penguins In traditional fashion Eager opted not to share similar sentiments with Pens enforcer Georges Laraque It will be interesting to see how Eager s act plays in the Windy City under the tight leash of the Chicago coaching staff Assistant coaches Mark Hardy and John Torchetti promptly dispatched Sean Avery from Los Angeles and the former Kings agitator offers something that Eager does not -- the ability to dent the twine In 23 games with the Flyers this season Eager was scoreless and was a minus-8 David Unkle can be reached at: topcatsports@canoemail com Which team benefits from the Scott Rolen for Troy Glaus trade Blue Jays Cardinals Both teams Results | Story

First to France where a burgeoning hip-hop talent by the name of Mosey is making waves with his beats his hooks and his genetic similarity to President Nicolas Sarkozy Yes it turns out that the French president who once called the disaffected youth of the banlieues scum has himself sired wannabe pondlife Which would be funny if it wasn t so flipping predictable The story regarding the rise of Sarkozy s son Pierre in the French hip-hop fraternity is reported this morning in the Independent and the Times but the Times account is both haughtier and more dubious in tone so we ll concentrate on that one "It emerged yesterday that Sarko junior a hip-hop producer who calls himself Mosey has written a song for Poison one of the angriest minstrels from the Paris banlieue ghettos " Minstrels - see it s already off to a good start Anyway the piece goes on to explain that Pierre s transformation into Mosey has been a while in the making Apparently while Sarkozy was interior minister and pledging to clear the streets of "racaille" (which the Times translates as "layabouts") he was also gently encouraging young Pierre to get the hell rid of the dreadlocks he was sporting at the time While Pierre obliged that wasn t the end of his love for Afro-Caribbean culture In fact it was only strengthened Hence the following MySpace blurb: "Hey Im Mosey a young parisian producer with my crew: da Crime Chantilly we produced hip hop soul and rnb beatz Credited on the dvd of Jamel Debouze 100%Debouze Produced the hiphop track La rue by Poison Produced the hiphop track freestyle by David Banner Credited on the making of of Selon Charlie by Nicole Garcia with benoit poelvoorde Composed the music of the tv show Rayon x " Now the irony of this particular situation lies not simply in the fact that Pierre has been able to turn his own privilege into a career in the very field antithetically opposed to all things Sarko senior There is another aspect too in that as soon as all of Mosey s rap mates find out who he really is his work schedule might no longer be quite so busy The Times goes on to replay an interview given by top minstrel Poison to hip-hop station Radio Generations They even translate it into quasi-English too just to make Poison sound more "street" or perhaps "stupid": "The guy brought me some music He does good sh**" the quote runs "I didn t know at the start that it was the son of Sarko When I found out I blew a fuse and phoned him He said Yeah but Poison I didn t wanna tell you cos you wouldn t wanna hang out wid me no more I told him hey no problem You never done me wrong We ll bust nobody s balls we ll just do good stuff " And so it was that the track La Rue from Poison s new album Mec de tess (variously translated as "city guy" "guy from the estates" and "guy from the hood") came into being Now that it s all out in the open perhaps Poison along with Pierre can collabo on a posse joint with the prez and his lover Italian singer Carla Bruni Now that would be well minstrel Adele Singer star icon Jesus To that list of professions ascribed to the singer (whose debut album ain t out till February) you can add "phrase coiner" after she created a new genre in which to file her tunes That genre Kim Dawson of Kim Dawson s Playlist reports is called "pathetic soul" As Adele explains to Kim this morning there s a long and complicated history to the name "They re pathetic love songs about being pathetic " she chats "I was listening back to my album and I just thought: Oh my god I m so pathetic when it comes to boys " If that ain t a sentiment to rally round in 2008 what is Finally Amy Winehouse has gone to a party in ballet slippers reports Gordon Smart Oh and she might soon start recording her new album with Mark Ronson "We have been talking about it and I know she really want to start recording She s got so many songs in her " Well better that than smack!

Jeanne To those who don t know:McGuinty had to tax all of us to the tune of I believe it was $900 00 each in order to get his books in order after the "Harris debacle" Harris left Ontario in a ton of debt but McGuinty cleaned it up I totally agree with Catherine who said: Mr Harper is a narrow minded zealot who can only view life through the eyes of the rich and wealthy In the States there appears to be fresh winds blowing which will oust the neo con Bush whom Harper absolutely worships The winds of change will blow to Canada too and re-establish the fairness and compassion that Canadians feel for all our citizens I just cannot decipher what has produced such mean and cruel people of the neo con faith and Harper is currently leading the pack Downey People in Canada REALLY need to stop relying on the government (taxpayers) Do for yourself!!! I know it s not your fault You have been brought up in a nanny state and it s hard to turn things around the right way If there are no jobs where you are create your own move do whatever just don t rely on the rest of the country to bail you out Ray Olson I remember a Premier named Bob Rae who racked up a 10 billion dollar debt a few years ago He is now running for the Libs good luck Ontario Stop whining and spending McGuinty!!!!!! McGuinty is a promise breaker and the voters of Ontario voted him a whopping majority! They must like burdening their future family members with the bill Amazing Ontarians or should I say Torontonians they sure know how to do it right! Jim McB Provincial infrastructure is deteriorating because for over a decade the federal government under the Liberals had to diminish the defecit They did that by increasing taxes downloading to the provinces and by other questionable manoevers like taking $40 Billion from the Military and RCMP peansion funds That said they did accomplish the task and put us in surplus That is why all your left wing social handout and solicitor perpetual endowment fund programs went down the tubes Now the government wants to help industry through a rough patch so that jobs (not handouts) can be maintained and to my mind that is exactly what is required Patricia there is nothing neocon or pro American in this scenario that should attract the venom of your words I have to chuckle at the media headline - imagine federal government spending being linked to a budget; how strange can it get The time has come for the tax and spend Liberals of Ontario to start cutting some of the fat from government instead of begging other levels of government to pay their bills Ontario is now 162 billion dollars in debt and we will be paying it off for ever McGuinty stop spending my money!!!!!!!!!!!Agreed that debt is a drain on provincial revenue resources The government should not be spending taxpayers money on industry - that is the responsibility of the private sector If their businesses are no longer profitable to them well then that s unfortunate but that is a reality of operating a business "First ministers to make demands at dinner with PM"What the usual 2nd & 3rd helpings I could not agree more Please stop racking up a debt that will eventually cripple the province of Ontario!Dalton McGunity has a great financial management record During his first term Dalton and his teams has been working so hard to reduce the deficit from the previous government Mike Harris and Erin Eves His goal was achieved!But federal government specifically Harper has refused to help to fix the problem that has been facing in Ontario which our economy sector is mainly focused on the manfacturing sectors and especially to Toronto s economy!

is a misconstrued statement There was in fact only a one year deficit due to the blackout and SARS There was no other fiscal shortfall inherited from the Harris government Well here we go again with all the Premiers showing up cap in hand I expect this is why our country sees so little progress on anything As a westerner I can only thank the voters of Ontario for electing Dalton McGuinty Had you not done that I m afraid we would have seen him in the federal parliament He s yours and you re welcome to him Sadly with such a diverse country the reality is also greatly emphasized regional differences And with all the premiers out to represent their own jurisdictions there will be no concensus It will end as always as a "dog eat dog" fight about how to divide up the resources of Canada Even Trudeau once asked "who speaks for Canada" Without some serious reform about HOW we govern our country I expect the answer will always be "nobody" And that will not change simply by sending another party to sit in Parliament and do the same things in the same way we always have Doing that guarantees we will always have a regionally divided Canada with citizens in the east constantly whining about citizens in the west And vice-versa welcome to the Canadian buffet All you can eat and stuff down your trowsers at one low price of bankruptcy Come one come all no one is refused and 2 seats for the price of one for all you disabled which is getting to be a very broad term in this nation:)What I don t see as useful or at all necessary in this story are the comments from the liberal senator and especially the former NDP leader Neither of these people belong to political parties that have ever done anything proactive concerning the economy At least Harper is meeting with the Premiers to discuss the issues so lets see what they come up with before being negative Frankly though I can t imagine what Harper can do to change the reality of this global economy at this point in time Until taxes are allotted more fairly and the provincial governments receive their fair share of the monies collected we will forever have deteriorating infrastructures in every province Canada has become a third world country with deteriorating cities dangerous rotted out roads and bridges a dying economy homelessness poverty etc etc Mr Harper is a narrow minded zealot who can only view life through the eyes of the rich snd wealthy In the States there appears to be fresh winds blowing which will oust the neo con Bush whom Harper absolutely worships The winds of change will blow to Canada too and re-establsh the fairness and compassion that Canadians feel for all our citizens I just cannot decipher what has produced such mean and cruel people of the neo con faith and Harper is currently leading the pack It s binge & purge time at the first ministers meeting Saddle on up to the trough first ministers & fill yer gulletsIt simply smacks of buying either a prolonged government or the next election The approval of the funds in such a situation can be approved with parliamentary support well before the next budget Such a ploy will backfire on the Conservatives It was the P-Cons who left Ontario in a mess Common sense Yes according to Harris/Eves/Flaherty Canada is next!To those that believe that the McGuinty government is racking up the debt please visit the Ministry of Finance s website at http://www fin gov on ca/english/budget/ontariobudgets/2007/papers_all html You will notice that the budget has been in a surplus position for some time It was Harris and some of his Con ministers (some of whom are in Ottawa now)that had mostly deficit budgets In terms of Ontario s economy according to Statsca only about`15%of its jobs are in manufacturing Ontario s economy is highly diversified All one need do is look at Toronto and see how many people are employed there How many work in factories Not to many most work in the service sector and the knowledge economy Those people who are working in manufacturing and losing their jobs do need help In terms of helping the auto sector many jurisdictions around the world do offer support in order to keep or lure plants This creates an unlevel playing field so to level it we should offer support as well hey Frank you have been living in that socialistic land way too long over there in Ontario It IS NOT the government s resposibility to bail out companies I am on my 4th career out here in the west!!! We never got a dime like poor poor Ontario Absolutley absurd to think that it is the governments responsibility to bail out companys that are destined to go down anyways You socialists think that the government is there to save you but you are so so wrong Stand up and do what you have to do to make things work We have done it out here your turn! It makes me so angry at the thought of my tax dollars going to Ontario to train people Train yourself I did!I think Steven B needs to wake up Harris promised to balance the budget but in the end failed Common public knowledge McGuinty has balanced the budget Holy smokes these people are allowed to vote RE DCR Lots of industries get a helping hand from the government Take er the oil industry for instance should we cut that off as of now When will the premiers learn it is their jobs to run their provinces If they want to subsidize their industries to save jobs have at it However use your own money Tax the citizens of that province accordingly if that is what is necessary Then let the citizens of the province decide if that is the best way to spend their tax dollars Too often the premiers want someone other than themselves to blame for their own incompetence The problem is people boycotting Liberal Cars nobosdy wants to buy them In the last several elections the Liberals name call everyone and so does the Liberal Union leader in Ontario They should not be surprised we are not interested in doing business with them The Ontario Premier is just trying to blame is poor job on someone else The Ontario Premier is also trying to get his brother int the Dederal Governement re-elected The meeting at 24 Sussesx Drive is good so their is less grand standing by the failing leader of Ontario Canada economy is super but nobody will buy Onatrio car and thats the Premiers fault not the Prime Ministers fault Think I will go test drive a car built by a non Liberal province I have been insulted enough by the Liberals for wanting my kids to go to a safe school and have my son to date the opposite sex Charles Dickens summed it up neatly "Please Sir " replied Oliver "I want some more "The Billion Dollar Man All sounds good for sound bites and headlines but think about what the money is really all about The loss of jobs plants homes cars money families and lives What s a billion dollars going to do Not one damn thing till the problem is faced Free Trade no matter how great it is for the investor is a curse for anyone in manufacturing today The tariff word or auto pact or legislated control of content volumes just seems to make the rich cry foul but it s the only way If an imported TV set from China is $499 and the US or Canadian made one is $1500 - which one is anyone going to buy Now if you create your smoke screens - like that in the food indusry - process the food in foreign countries and then falsely represent your products as so called Canadian Made because you ship it in a Canadian box - must be outlawed So will the billion dollar man get his budget past Not a hope in hell But hey - we just sat on our fingers for 2 years of hell so who knows These are times like no other Here s what and you may ridicule all you want The banks are gonna go bust and the Bank of Canada(money of last resort) is gonna loan the government not the banks 10s of billions of dollars More billions are gonna be forked over without condition because the figures and stats are here for an economic collapse So back to politics throw this back in Harper s face Either way money will in the coming months be going to communities and sectors all over Canada Finally money is issued through debt and we all pay for itYou can pump money hand over fist into the auto sector but it will mean nothing unless people buy the product That hasn t been happening and will not until the big three smarten up As for McGinty once again putting on a grandstand show I guess it s easier to do that than attempt to solve problems Ontario and Quebec should get nothing For years the western provinces have suffered with little or no help from Ottowa Sometimes what goes around comes around Once again the Harper team will do anything to stay in control This billion dollar promise being tied to having the opposition pass the budget and therefore support the Conservatives is political blackmail The time has come for Canada We have had a fantastic run economically and a slow down is evident We have been very fotunate and have reaped the rewards Lets be "thankful" and be cautious with financial decisions going forward I choose not to vote for the Conservative party because they don t care about the average Canadian and will go above and beyone for Corporate Canada I remember the economical nightware Ontarion was in when we had Conservative government Vote Conservative means voting for a recession I love Canada but no a conservative Canada!To those who don t know:McGuinty had to tax all of us to the tune of I believe it was $900 00 each in order to get his books in order after the "Harris debacle" Harris left Ontario in a ton of debt but McGuinty cleaned it up I totally agree with Catherine who said:Mr Harper is a narrow minded zealot who can only view life through the eyes of the rich and wealthy In the States there appears to be fresh winds blowing which will oust the neo con Bush whom Harper absolutely worships The winds of change will blow to Canada too and re-establish the fairness and compassion that Canadians feel for all our citizens I just cannot decipher what has produced such mean and cruel people of the neo con faith and Harper is currently leading the pack People in Canada REALLY need to stop relying on the government (taxpayers) Do for yourself!!! I know it s not your fault You have been brought up in a nanny state and it s hard to turn things around the right way If there are no jobs where you are create your own move do whatever just don t rely on the rest of the country to bail you out I remember a Premier named Bob Rae who racked up a 10 billion dollar debt a few years ago He is now running for the Libs good luck Ontario McGuinty is a promise breaker and the voters of Ontario voted him a whopping majority! They must like burdening their future family members with the bill Amazing Ontarians or should I say Torontonians they sure know how to do it right!Provincial infrastructure is deteriorating because for over a decade the federal government under the Liberals had to diminish the defecit They did that by increasing taxes downloading to the provinces and by other questionable manoevers like taking $40 Billion from the Military and RCMP peansion funds That said they did accomplish the task and put us in surplus That is why all your left wing social handout and solicitor perpetual endowment fund programs went down the tubes Now the government wants to help industry through a rough patch so that jobs (not handouts) can be maintained and to my mind that is exactly what is required Patricia there is nothing neocon or pro American in this scenario that should attract the venom of your words I have to chuckle at the media headline - imagine federal government spending being linked to a budget; how strange can it get Video Related Stories User Tools Top Stories

It makes me so angry at the thought of my tax dollars going to Ontario to train people Train yourself I did!I think Steven B needs to wake up Harris promised to balance the budget but in the end failed Common public knowledge McGuinty has balanced the budget Holy smokes these people are allowed to vote RE DCR Lots of industries get a helping hand from the government Take er the oil industry for instance should we cut that off as of now When will the premiers learn it is their jobs to run their provinces If they want to subsidize their industries to save jobs have at it However use your own money Tax the citizens of that province accordingly if that is what is necessary Then let the citizens of the province decide if that is the best way to spend their tax dollars Too often the premiers want someone other than themselves to blame for their own incompetence The problem is people boycotting Liberal Cars nobosdy wants to buy them In the last several elections the Liberals name call everyone and so does the Liberal Union leader in Ontario They should not be surprised we are not interested in doing business with them The Ontario Premier is just trying to blame is poor job on someone else The Ontario Premier is also trying to get his brother int the Dederal Governement re-elected The meeting at 24 Sussesx Drive is good so their is less grand standing by the failing leader of Ontario Canada economy is super but nobody will buy Onatrio car and thats the Premiers fault not the Prime Ministers fault Think I will go test drive a car built by a non Liberal province I have been insulted enough by the Liberals for wanting my kids to go to a safe school and have my son to date the opposite sex Charles Dickens summed it up neatly "Please Sir " replied Oliver "I want some more "The Billion Dollar Man All sounds good for sound bites and headlines but think about what the money is really all about The loss of jobs plants homes cars money families and lives What s a billion dollars going to do Not one damn thing till the problem is faced Free Trade no matter how great it is for the investor is a curse for anyone in manufacturing today The tariff word or auto pact or legislated control of content volumes just seems to make the rich cry foul but it s the only way If an imported TV set from China is $499 and the US or Canadian made one is $1500 - which one is anyone going to buy Now if you create your smoke screens - like that in the food indusry - process the food in foreign countries and then falsely represent your products as so called Canadian Made because you ship it in a Canadian box - must be outlawed So will the billion dollar man get his budget past Not a hope in hell But hey - we just sat on our fingers for 2 years of hell so who knows These are times like no other Here s what and you may ridicule all you want The banks are gonna go bust and the Bank of Canada(money of last resort) is gonna loan the government not the banks 10s of billions of dollars More billions are gonna be forked over without condition because the figures and stats are here for an economic collapse So back to politics throw this back in Harper s face Either way money will in the coming months be going to communities and sectors all over Canada Finally money is issued through debt and we all pay for itYou can pump money hand over fist into the auto sector but it will mean nothing unless people buy the product That hasn t been happening and will not until the big three smarten up As for McGinty once again putting on a grandstand show I guess it s easier to do that than attempt to solve problems Ontario and Quebec should get nothing For years the western provinces have suffered with little or no help from Ottowa Sometimes what goes around comes around Once again the Harper team will do anything to stay in control This billion dollar promise being tied to having the opposition pass the budget and therefore support the Conservatives is political blackmail The time has come for Canada We have had a fantastic run economically and a slow down is evident We have been very fotunate and have reaped the rewards Lets be "thankful" and be cautious with financial decisions going forward I choose not to vote for the Conservative party because they don t care about the average Canadian and will go above and beyone for Corporate Canada I remember the economical nightware Ontarion was in when we had Conservative government Vote Conservative means voting for a recession I love Canada but no a conservative Canada!To those who don t know:McGuinty had to tax all of us to the tune of I believe it was $900 00 each in order to get his books in order after the "Harris debacle" Harris left Ontario in a ton of debt but McGuinty cleaned it up I totally agree with Catherine who said:Mr Harper is a narrow minded zealot who can only view life through the eyes of the rich and wealthy In the States there appears to be fresh winds blowing which will oust the neo con Bush whom Harper absolutely worships The winds of change will blow to Canada too and re-establish the fairness and compassion that Canadians feel for all our citizens I just cannot decipher what has produced such mean and cruel people of the neo con faith and Harper is currently leading the pack People in Canada REALLY need to stop relying on the government (taxpayers) Do for yourself!!! I know it s not your fault You have been brought up in a nanny state and it s hard to turn things around the right way If there are no jobs where you are create your own move do whatever just don t rely on the rest of the country to bail you out I remember a Premier named Bob Rae who racked up a 10 billion dollar debt a few years ago He is now running for the Libs good luck Ontario McGuinty is a promise breaker and the voters of Ontario voted him a whopping majority! They must like burdening their future family members with the bill Amazing Ontarians or should I say Torontonians they sure know how to do it right!Provincial infrastructure is deteriorating because for over a decade the federal government under the Liberals had to diminish the defecit They did that by increasing taxes downloading to the provinces and by other questionable manoevers like taking $40 Billion from the Military and RCMP peansion funds That said they did accomplish the task and put us in surplus That is why all your left wing social handout and solicitor perpetual endowment fund programs went down the tubes Now the government wants to help industry through a rough patch so that jobs (not handouts) can be maintained and to my mind that is exactly what is required Patricia there is nothing neocon or pro American in this scenario that should attract the venom of your words I have to chuckle at the media headline - imagine federal government spending being linked to a budget; how strange can it get Video Related Stories User Tools Top Stories

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: Joe Paterno entertains on eve of bowl By FRANK BODANI Daily Record/Sunday News SAN ANTONIO -- You never know what you re going to get out of a Joe Paterno press conference anymore And maybe that s to be expected considering the 81-year-old Penn State coach often is crotchety sarcastic witty and complimentary -- all in the same 30-minute give-and-take with reporters Nearly always though he is entertaining Just like Friday as he sat next to Texas A&M interim head coach Gary Darnell The two men met the media leading up to tonight s Alamo Bowl And it was a doozy First Paterno was asked for his reaction to the crass comments made by a Texas A&M "yell leader " or male cheerleader at the dual pep rally here the night before The Texas A&M student inexplicably used this as part of his rant to the crowd: "Joe Paterno s on his death bed! And someone needs to find him a casket!" Penn State fans booed A&M officials quickly apologized to Penn State officials -- including wife Sue Paterno -- and the "yell leader" was sent home with his parents When asked about it Friday Paterno smiled and shrugged it off "I think everybody s got to take things you know with a grain of salt It s some young guy up there and he s trying to be funny -- and maybe he s accurate I don t know "I honestly didn t hear it and I don t particularly care about it My mom used to say to me when they used to call me a wop walking down the street Sticks and stones will break your bones but names will never hurt you " Advertisement Then there was Paterno not understanding a question about defensing Texas A&M running back Javorskie Lane who is listed at 275 pounds but is probably even larger "Say that again Say it a little slower I m sorry " Paterno said "Are you talking to me " The question was repeated and Paterno still did not understand "I m not sure where you re coming from on that baby Are you wanting me to know whether somebody s too heavy or what " Finally he got it "Oh oh oh oh I ve got ya He s a big strong tough kid and we ve worked like dogs on our tackling and making sure we get our tails tucked under and don t try to out-muscle him and the whole bit " Of course there was the joking side of the old coach When someone asked him about the significance of coaching his 500th game tonight he downplayed the milestone credited the players on both teams and said this: "I always like to tell the story about the Italian who couldn t count "They asked him if he could count and he said Yeah I can count One two three " Paterno said holding up one finger at a time "And they said Can you count any higher He said Sure I can count higher One two three " a smiling Paterno said as he raised his hand higher before counting on his fingers again There also was the gruff side of the old coach When a reporter asked about why he changed his mind and did not allow three of his defensive players to make the bowl trip he brushed it off (they have been charged by police in relation to an on-campus fight and the moments after it) "Forget about it will you Let s talk about the football game for crying out loud They re not here What do you want me to do They re not here and you know why they re not here so forget about it " But the strangest funniest and most awkward moment of the press conference came toward the end It left Paterno Darnell and the room full of reporters busting up in laughter Ray Saul the former sports editor of the Hazleton Standard Speaker seemed to ask about Paterno s coaching longevity Saul who said he is six weeks older than Paterno started the back-and-forth this way: "My girlfriend said you can still do it " Paterno: "Said what " Reporter: "You re in great shape and you can still do it I think you can still do it You have been doing it and you will continue to do it " Paterno: "What are you talking about doing Holy smoke I m not Hugh Hefner you know " Then while laughing with everyone else coach Darnell chimed in: "I didn t know these things were that personal " Paterno: "Should we bring wives to these things " The coach quickly recovered though and went on talking about his desire to continue coaching The press conference ended a few minutes later And everyone left the room smiling and shaking their heads once again ---------- Frank Bodani is a writer for the York Daily Record/Sunday News He may be reached at fbodani@ydr com Nittany Lions-Aggies at a glance Game data: Alamo Bowl Penn State Nittany Lions vs Texas A&M Aggies Tonight 8 p m at the Alamodome in San Antonio Media: TV -- ESPN Radio -- WCHA (800 AM) Teams: Penn State is 8-4 A&M is 7-5 Series: The Lions lead 2-1 including a 24-0 win in the 1999 Alamo Bowl Did you know : Joe Paterno has taken teams to 13 different bowl games winning in 11 locales more than anyone in college football history Line: Penn State by 5 1/2 Bodani s pick: Penn State 27 Texas A&M 13 Enough Lions seem intent on erasing the underachieving of the regular season This has the making of a "statement game" from the offensive and defensive lines which return nearly everyone next year Playing close to home could help A&M though finding some decent defense would help more (prediction record: 8-4)

ORLANDO Fla In the final game of his brilliant college football career Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan threw three touchdown passes in a 24-21 victory over Michigan State in the Champs Sports Bowl on Friday night But not all went so well Ryan who will graduate with a degree in management was asked to grade his final performance which no doubt will be studied by scouts from the National Football League I m always a tough grader Ryan said I would say a B Perhaps that was fair Although Ryan completed 22 of 47 passes for 249 yards he turned the ball over twice the second time on a fumble while being sacked in the fourth quarter It led to a Spartans touchdown that added some late tension to a sloppy game I didn t see him coming Ryan said I should have taken better care of the ball But the Spartans squandered their last chance to score with their fifth turnover Now Ryan will head to the N F L probably as a first-round draft choice He will play in a league with quarterback Tom Brady of the New England Patriots the other well-known quarterback in that part of Massachusetts Asked if Brady was his role model Ryan said: It would be silly not to watch Tom Brady He s classy on and off the field Another star of the Eagles (11-3) was free safety Jamie Silva who had two of the four interceptions thrown by Michigan State quarterback Brian Hoyer Silva and Ryan are two of the 17 fifth-year seniors on the Eagles roster The victory gave the Eagles eight consecutive bowl victories the longest current streak in college football You never want to be the team to end the streak Silva said His most important interception came late in the first quarter with Michigan State holding a 7-0 lead Silva intercepted a pass on the Boston College goal line and returned it 38 yards Instead of falling behind by 14-0 the Eagles tied the score 7-7 before the quarter ended They did not trail again Ryan s pivotal moment came early in the fourth quarter when the Eagles lead was 17-13 On first-and-10 from the Boston College 32 Ryan connected with Rich Gunnell for a 68-yard scoring play Gunnell s second touchdown of the game Despite their record the Eagles fell short of their goals In late October Ryan was a Heisman Trophy contender and Boston College ranked second thought it had a chance to reach a Bowl Championship Series game But the Eagles lost consecutive games in November and the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game to Virginia Tech settling for a lesser bowl under Jeff Jagodzinski their first-year coach It sure beats losing Jagodzinski said of the final game It was big to get to 11 wins We haven t done that at B C since 1940 Ryan added: We fell a little bit short but this is a great way to go out Michigan State Coach Mark Dantonio who is also in his first year with his team said It felt like we were in control of the football game Obviously turnovers hurt us he added In addition to four interceptions Hoyer fumbled a snap Javon Ringer who gained 101 yards on 21 carries for Michigan State said: We never lost a game by more than a touchdown We just kept fighting all the way to the end of the season The Spartans (7-6) played without five players who were suspended because of academic ineligibility or for violating team rules Among them were defensive end Jonal Saint-Dic and linebacker SirDarean Adams The Florida Citrus Bowl will also play host to the Capital One Bowl on Tuesday featuring the Spartans rival Michigan against Florida This resulted in a curious juxtaposition of fans in this city In the hotels here the crowds in the lobbies often mixed the green and white of the Spartans with the maize and blue of the Wolverines But the rivalry was manifested on the scoreboard in an unusual way Fans here are allowed to send text messages to the scoreboard from their cellphones During the first half an off-color message regarding Lloyd Carr the retiring coach of Michigan was posted on the scoreboard A spokesman for the bowl committee said the word slipped through a censoring filter but was quickly erased

Longer legs more attractive Friday 18 Jan 2008 13:47 The stereotype of a leggy blonde being the most attractive type of person could be true at least in part a new study suggests Polish researchers found that people prefer legs a few inches longer than average Boguslaw Pawlowski and Piotr Sorokowski at the University of Wroclaw in Poland base their findings on the opinions of 218 male and female volunteers the New Scientist reports They were asked to rate the attractiveness of seven male and seven female images which were altered so that they were the same height but with leg lengths that varied five ten and 15 per cent from the Polish national norm The researchers also measured the volunteers proportions Regardless of the volunteers height the most popular image was the one with leg length five per cent longer than average Next best were deemed to be average length and then legs that were ten per cent longer "Long legs are signalling health " said Dr Pawlowski He argues that short legs are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and type two diabetes Although the study was limited to Polish people the researchers say each culture would be likely to find people with longer legs more attractive

To USC Williams poses threat BEVERLY HILLS Calif (AP) - Juice Williams isn t close to being in Vince Young s league So said two members of the Southern California defense although clearly they meant no disrespect to the Illinois quarterback Even Williams wouldn t dispute that notion No comparison at all USC defensive end Lawrence Jackson said Friday recalling Young s incredible performance in the Rose Bowl two years ago when the Texas star ran and passed the Longhorns to a 41-38 victory against the Trojans to win the national championship He s no Vince Young Trojans cornerback Terrell Thomas said Williams threw four touchdown passes in No 13 Illinois stunning 28-21 victory at then-No 1 Ohio State on Nov 10 He also ran for three first downs as the Illini kept the ball for the final 8:09 If the sixth-ranked Trojans are to beat Illinois in the Rose Bowl on Tuesday they know they ve got to contain Williams the type of quarterback who s given them problems in recent years Young s Rose Bowl performance was unforgettable 467 total yards with three rushing touchdowns and Washington s Jake Locker and Oregon s Dennis Dixon hurt the Trojans this year with their running and passing Vince Young has some special stuff to him Jackson said On film we felt confident we could stop Vince He had the it factor He was able to get out like Superman Regarding Williams Jackson said: He makes all the throws He knows where to get the ball There s kind of a gray area you don t know how fast a guy is until you get out on the field Thomas also praised Williams but didn t hesitate when asked about a similarity to Young He was a supreme being in college football Thomas said [Williams] isn t there yet Juice is a good quarterback the potential s there That s like saying [Illinois running back Rashard] Mendenhall is no Reggie Bush Mendenhall was an All-Big Ten first-team performer this season But the development of Williams as a sophomore probably was a bigger reason why the Illini (9-3) turned their program around after five-straight losing seasons USC defensive coordinator Nick Holt said Williams reminded him of Locker because of his physical nature It s almost like they re playing 12 guys the quarterback s another running back Holt said He s a physical runner like Locker He can run over you He might not run 70 yards for a touchdown I don t think he s as fast as Vince Young Holt said he believes the current USC defense is much better equipped to deal with an explosive offense than the 2005 version was against Texas We were banged up two years ago he said I don t think there s a comparison with this defense We re fast and physical and I think that we surprise people because they have the stigma of the West Coast that there s more offense than defense In winning their final four games the Trojans (10-2) outscored the opposition 116-51 USC wound up second in total defense (258 8-yard average) and fourth in scoring defense (15 9-point average) This defense has been playing lights out USC nose tackle Sedrick Ellis said This defense has been spectacular against the run as well as the pass It is going to be a good challenge to stop this offense I think it s going to be hard for them as well Williams said USC s defense was similar to Ohio State s in terms of team speed The top-ranked Buckeyes who face LSU in the national championship game were ranked the country s top team in total defense Williams said he watched the Texas-USC game of two years ago the day before the Illini flew west to begin preparations for their first Rose Bowl in 24 years They fell behind (Young) led his troops down the field Williams said That s something I want to do on Tuesday I was watching it to pick up some things I was just trying to see what he saw on film I saw some things he did It s very hard to stop a mobile quarterback who knows what he s doing Regarding a comparison to Young Williams smiled and said: Six-foot-5 I can t do that Great speed His shoes are hard to fill Jackson always engaging with the media has added an element of interest by referring to Williams as Isiah even though he doesn t know him I m not a big fan of nicknames His Mom named him Isiah I call him Isiah Jackson said Juice Williams that s a cool name I can t see myself calling him Juice Williams smiled upon hearing that news I ve been called Juice for a while he said I have no preference I m just happy to be here for the Rose Bowl I m not here for the trash talk I m here to have fun and play ball However he added: We met (the Trojans) at Disneyland They welcomed us They ve actually been pretty nice They have been very humble They re not the arrogant guys you think they were They re a great team I m looking forward to a good game The following are comments from the readers In no way

CHAPEL HILL N C --- Top-ranked North Carolina Tarheels hasn t encountered much danger on the court this season But the Tar Heels Hall of Fame coach is apparently having trouble navigating around his cluttered office these days Roy Williams cut his scalp and needed five stitches Friday when he tripped over a cord in his office and hit his head on a door giving the Tar Heels a bumpy start to their final day of practice for Saturday s game against rival North Carolina State Williams was on his feet unaided immediately after the accident though he was unable to attend an afternoon news conference or appear on ESPN Radio for a scheduled interview He showed for practice later in the afternoon sporting a USA Basketball cap Williams was in good spirits and chuckled at his fall jokingly claiming that he needed 36 stitches He said he was stepping over a table when his foot got tangled in a cord for a VCR remote control in an office containing about two dozen basketballs for him to autograph "The office is too small for all that dadgum memorabilia " he said In an odd twist it marks the second straight time a coach s health became an issue as the rivals met in the Smith Center Last year Wolfpack coach Sidney Lowe -- sick from flu-like symptoms leading up to the game -- was taken to a hospital because of dehydration and missed the second half of an 83-64 loss Because it was quickly apparent that Williams was OK his fall had taken on a humorous tone by the time All-American Tyler Hansbrough spoke with reporters before practice When asked whether he had ever seen a remote control that still required a cord Hansbrough said "I wouldn t mess with Coach like that " North Carolina (16-0 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) is off to its best start since the 1997-98 team won its first 17 games The Tar Heels have been atop The Associated Press Top 25 poll for 10 weeks their longest stretch since the 1985-86 team spent 13 weeks there and started 21-0 N C State (11-3) has won seven straight games since a stunning loss to East Carolina on Dec 8 though the Wolfpack could be without starting guard Courtney Fells and reserve forward Dennis Horner who each have sprained ankles N C State already lost starting point guard Farnold Degand (knee) for the rest of the season leaving the Wolfpack shorthanded against a North Carolina team that likes to run from start to finish In addition N C State hasn t looked sharp in recent wins against Western Carolina and a pair of teams -- Presbyterian and North Carolina Central -- that each had just one victory when they met "As a coach I can t look at that and say We struggled against these guys so we re going to struggle (against UNC) " Lowe said "I have to think that You know what We did what we had to do to win the game And now we re in a situation where we re going to have to do whatever we can to win the game " Copyright 2008 by The Associated Press

In this edition of Broadcasting & Cable TechTalk Senior Editor Glen Dickson reports developments in mobile DTV--including an on-the-road test run on the Las Vegas strip Related Stories: If you want to know when the writers strike is going to end it is starting to look pretty simple Either it will get settled within a few weeks or we re in for the very long haul With the directors deal now done we re about to find out quickly At least that was the sense floating around the television industry after the Directors Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers cut a deal last Thursday The hope is that the DGA-AMPTP deal is close enough to what the Writers Guild of America wants that it will get those two pals back to the table Then a deal could be made with both sides saving face Of course that is the most important part of any contract negotiation As Randy Jackson would say Welcome to Hollywood The AMPTP could say it wrestled a favorable deal from the DGA that pressured the WGA back to the table The WGA could say its actions got the DGA a better deal and pulled the AMPTP closer to the WGA demands Bottom line everyone can go back to work and I can go back to cheering for McDreamy to dump that pain in the arse Meredith and do what I would do with his looks date everyone in Seattle At the same time Word is that WGA lawyers and negotiators should know within a month if the DGA-AMPTP deal is good enough to get the WGA and the AMPTP back to the table First the WGA has to examine the deal and decide if Internet revenue is to its liking Then it needs to look like it is not being pressured back to the table In a sit down last week one day before the DGA-AMPTP deal was made WGA West President Patric Verrone told me they will look closely at the DGA deal But he warned that a DGA settlement wouldn t necessarily change the situation Some writers and showrunners have no interest in bowing to whatever the DGA and AMPTP serve up Conversely there is a growing number of more moderate showrunners who are anxious to use the DGA accord to get back to work What happens if the WGA decides the AMPTP-DGA deal isn t enough Then you may be still reading about the strike from your beach house in the Hamptons In the short term Verrone says the WGA will continue to try and pressure the AMPTP back to the table through tactics like cutting more interim deals with independent production companies doing to the Grammys and Oscars what they did to the Golden Globes Costing a conglomerate tens of millions of dollars I assume has some effect I hope it s a positive one in the long run for us he says But as one network executive pointed out We are multibillion-dollar conglomerates These awards shows are a blip Unless the Oscars splinter the Screen Actors Guild or the WGA I don t know what would get the sides back to the table in the next few months once the DGA deal and award season passes That s especially so if ratings even remotely hold up through the spring The conglomerates are cutting costs now through a combination of killing development deals cutting back on pilots and not producing any scripted series The networks are confident there will be some sort of upfront selling season But if the strike goes on for a few months more in addition to ratings losses the strike will begin hurting revenue streams like international and home video Significant layoffs could begin The bottom line: the AMPTP-DGA deal may be the last best hope to settle the writers strike E-mail comments to ben grossman@reedbusiness com

Clemson coach Tommy Bowden has no ill feelings toward Auburn CHARLES GOLDBERG News staff writer Friday December 28 2007 ATLANTA - There s no animosity no family feud seemingly no problems at all But then again Tommy Bowden has never showed any ill will toward Auburn a school where he once coached where his brother unceremoniously lost his job as head coach a school that once chose to cancel a game against his father The Clemson coach is set to become the first Bowden to directly be involved in an Auburn football game since his brother Terry infamously left the program during the 1998 season Clemson plays Auburn in the Chick-fil-A Bowl at 6:30 p m Monday and the pragmatic Bowden sees little reason to correlate the game with his excitable brother and his past "No not really " Tommy Bowden said "Terry has still got records there and had a very productive career But this is a very volatile profession and Auburn is no different than Clemson Florida Michigan or Nebraska " No different maybe but Auburn is always a day away from a headline Even the otherwise-pragmatic Tommy Bowden knows that "I ve talked to Terry but not about this game " he said "What we talked about is if he takes the West Virginia job Did you know Auburn plays them next year " Now that is a stop-the-presses Bowden headline waiting to happen Tommy Bowden is sure not to create one this week In fact he s sided with Auburn and Tommy Tuberville since his brother left Tommy Bowden was one of the few head coaches in America that voted Auburn No 1 at the end of the 2004 regular season when the Tigers were bounding toward their 13-0 season There were no hard feelings then about his brother or the fact Auburn canceled a game against his father Florida State s Bobby Bowden after Terry left the Tigers CONTINUED 1 | 2 | 3 Next

Premier League - Warnock in winning Lane return Eurosport - James Scowcroft s first-half strike ensured a triumphant return to Bramall Lane for former Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock as Crystal Palace beat the Blades 1-0 Palace striker Scowcroft pounced to hook home Ben Watson s deflected free-kick in the 38th minute to heap more misery on Blades boss Bryan Robson and extend the Londoners unbeaten run to 12 matches Warnock making his first trip to Bramall Lane since walking out on his hometown club following relegation from the Premier League in May allowed himself muted celebrations as the Blades crashed to a fourth defeat in their last six Championship matches Robson has endured a miserable start to the season since replacing Warnock and has come under increasing pressure from Blades fans in recent weeks as their promotion challenge falters But in the second half against Palace Robson s side were the dominant force and could have taken at least a point if they had converted just one of several clear-cut chances Sporting Life / Eurosport

Bulls eye Jones for key coaching job 28 December 2007 11:12 Johannesburg - The Bulls negotiations to secure the part-time services of Eddie Jones - the former Australian World Cup coach who played a significant part in the Springboks 2007 World Cup success - could be finalised as early as Thursday next week Jones currently coaches the Saracens in the English Premiership and the Heineken Cup competitions He also assisted Jake White in preparing the Springbok team before and during the World Cup in France It was originally hoped to finalise negotiations with Jones and the Saracens during the week preceding Christmas However CEO of the Blue Bulls Company Barend van Graan said negotiations were put on hold as Jones had left for Japan on rugby matters It nevertheless seems a foregone conclusion that the Bulls will obtain the services of Jones to occasionally assist new Bulls coach Frans Ludeke with the backline It will undoubtedly help to alleviate the void that was left with the departure of Australian Todd Louden who was in charge of the backs for the past few years at the Bulls Next week s negotiations with Saracens and Jones will probably focus on the dates on which Jones can be released by the English club to assist the Bulls in Pretoria It is ironic that Jones coached the Reds against the Bulls in this year s Super 14 competition when the Bulls beat the Queenslanders by a record-winning margin of 92-3 to ensure a place in the semifinal of the Super 14 series The Bulls went on to win the Super 14 competition by beating the Sharks in the final with that famous last-gasp Bryan Habana try well after the hooter had sounded - Sapa

It s not monkey more likely a Punjabi abuse It now transpires that Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh may have used a colloquial Punjabi curse that sounds suspiciously like "monkey" during his spat with Andrew Symonds making the Australian cricketer misinterpret it as a racial abuse The tourists may argue at Harbhajan s appeal hearing that what he said cannot be termed a racial slur but was a commonly mouthed abuse used more in reflex in Punjab and northern India While this defence may land him in hot water for being abusive on the field it may clear him of the more serious charge of racial villification A date for Harbhajan s appeal hearing before New Zealand High Court judge John Hansen is yet to be decided Australian Brad Hogg will have his case heard in Perth Monday for allegedly calling Indian captain Anil Kumble and vice-captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni "bastards" during the second Test in Sydney Australia will argue the term "bastard" does not insult a person s descent after Hogg like Harbhajan was charged under section 3 3 of the International Cricket Council s (ICC) code of conduct during the drama-filled Sydney Test While Hogg is expected to admit he used the term "bastard" Harbhajan maintains he never said "monkey" "He didn t say that He is not a racist but maybe he said something else " an Indian official admitted Friday It is unclear whether Harbhajan used his Punjabi defence in his initial hearing Monday but Symonds and teammates Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke are adamant they heard the "monkey" gibe reports Herald Sun Australian players are also adamant Harbhajan initially taunted the Queenslander with this slur during a one-day international in Mumbai in October The tourists are bewildered that match referee Mike Procter believed evidence given by Hayden and Clarke but not that of Sachin Tendulkar who refuted the claims Tendulkar was batting with Harbhajan when the incident happened at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) The tourists remain incensed that Harbhajan was banned for three Tests without any television footage or audio replay proving him guilty or confirmation from umpires Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson - meaning match referee Mike Procter had to rely solely on the word of the Australian players An Indian team source was quoted in the media as saying that Procter strangely took private notes and did not record evidence Harbhajan s main defence is that how could Procter come to a conclusion when there was no audio and video evidence and when even the umpires have not heard it As already reported irate senior Indian players are pushing to boycott the triangular one-day series later this summer if Harbhajan s ban is not overturned The general belief in the Indian camp is that the Australians have worked to a plan knowing fully well that Harbhajan would react if provoked Otherwise why should only Harbhajan and Symonds get involved in these incidents asked an Indian player who also felt that they wanted distract Harbhajan s focus on the game Symonds sparked a furore when he questioned Harbhajan over why he had touched Brett Lee on the bottom during one of the fast bowler s overs IANS Tags: monkey punjabi abuse harbhajan symonds 0 Comments Share Blog Print

Vietnamese boy in good condition after risky surgery Tim Shufelt Canwest News Service; Ottawa Citizen Published: Thursday January 17 2008 Ten-year-old Hoang Son Pham underwent the first step Wednesday in an estimated year-long risky procedure to remove a massive growth from his face Late in the afternoon Children s Hospital Boston said in a statement the "procedure was a success and that he is in good condition " Doctors performed a tracheostomy on the Vietnamese boy to insert a semi-permanent tube that will keep air flowing to his lungs should subsequent treatments cause excessive swelling in his throat Before heading into surgery Wednesday afternoon Son Pham was a little scared but relieved the process was finally underway said the manager of Ottawa-based Children s Bridge Foundation Kate Maslen who discovered the boy in an orphanage outside Hanoi almost two years ago "He s so determined to get this condition treated I was amazed he didn t cry he was calm and very very brave He s an amazing kid " Maslen said over the phone from the hospital s cafeteria In fact after doctors explained to Son Pham on Tuesday what would happen to him he was in very good spirits playing in the snow in Boston said Olwyn Walter president of the foundation that has been taking care of the boy since he arrived in Canada in June The tube will remain until the boy completes a series of treatments aimed at shrinking the football-sized mass that continues to grow over the left side of his face Son Pham suffers from a vascular anomaly in which tightly packed clusters of blood vessels multiply at an unusually high rate producing a growth called a hemangioma "There s just a huge mass of blood in his cheek " Walter said "The doctors were able to squeeze the mass on the front part of his mouth and they could squeeze it right down to nothing the blood just moved to another part " The next phase of treatment to be performed by a team of specialists is designed to reduce that blood mass the sheer volume of which adds to the risk of complications An agent will be injected directly into the veins of the growth that will cause the blood to clot and harden which should ultimately lead to the collapse of the blood vessels But it will get worse for Son Pham before it gets better The injections will make the growth bruised and even more swollen "That s the hardest part of all this " Walter said "Hopefully we ll get through this part quickly in the next couple of months and then start seeing some results " Between rounds of injections the boy will stay with Walter in Halifax After what doctors say will be at least a year of treatment to reduce the blood mass surgery to remove the remaining tissue will be possible Walter said The decision to treat Son Pham was made after doctors in Boston reportedly determined the growth which could eventually obstruct the boy s breathing could be reduced in size by 90 per cent That conflicted with the assessment made at Toronto s Hospital for Sick Children where after four months of tests doctors ruled out removal of the hemangioma as too dangerous and complex To cover Son Pham s medical costs the Ray Tye Medical Foundation in Boston has donated $150 000 and the Boston hospital has donated the time of the doctors involved Donations from Canadians to the Children s Bridge Foundation will cover the remaining $200 000 "It s been incredible " Walter said of the outpouring of support "Son as he s getting older he s starting to grasp just how many people are on his side It really does mean a lot to him " CanWest News Service 2008

Jan 06 2008 The day after Intel announced that it would leave the One Laptop Per Child board the nonprofit organization shot back that the chip giant had contributed little to help the project during its six months with the group In a statement Jan 4 the OLPC project claimed that Intel violated written agreements with the board of directors did not help in developing software with the project and "disparaged" the OLPC s XO laptop "We have always embraced and welcomed other low-cost laptop providers to join us in this mission " the OLPC statement said "But since joining the OLPC Board of Directors in July Intel has violated its written agreement with OLPC on numerous occasions Intel continued to disparage the XO laptop in developing nations that had already decided to partner with OLPC (Uruguay and Peru) with countries that were in the midst of choosing a laptop solution (Brazil and Nigeria) and even small and remote places (Mongolia) " When Intel announced Jan 3 that it would leave the OLPC board an Intel spokesperson told Reuters that the nonprofit organization wanted Intel to focus "exclusively on the OLPC system " Intel has its own low-cost laptop for emerging markets called the Classmate and is working on a processor code-named Diamondville designed for use in these types of PCs Now that Intel has left the OLPC project the organization will go back to using chips from Advanced Micro Devices In its own statement the OLPC even took Intel to task over the way it handled its departure from the group claiming Intel made the announcement without consulting with the OLPC board first The nonprofit said it was not discouraged by Intel s departure and planned to move forward "The benefit [of] the departure of Intel from the OLPC board is a renewed clarity in purpose and the marketplace; we will continue to focus on our mission of providing every child with an opportunity for learning " the organization said in its statement Roger Kay an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates said the OLPC project will continue and AMD should be able to supply it with all the microprocessors it needs However Intel s departure from the board is a significant blow to the nonprofit s credibility within the IT industry he said "The point is that entities like the OLPC need a company like Intel on its board and if you lose them then who are your friends " Kay said Kay also criticized the OLPC for running its operation more like an academic exercise than a business that sells laptops at a low cost Intel Kay said wants to make a profit and it s unrealistic that Intel would cut its ties with other companies in order to work exclusively with the OLPC "You can t pretend like your suppliers are not in the business world " Kay said adding that Intel had been a reluctant partner of the OLPC anyway Simon Yates an analyst with Forrester Research agreed that Intel and the OLPC were mismatched for this type of project "They had very different motivations and were never on the same page in terms of expectations " Yates wrote in an e-mail to eWEEK "In my opinion a successful strategy for emerging markets requires a good mix of three motivations--fear greed and citizenship You need to be fearful that if you don t develop a solution someone else will step in You need to be greedy enough to see a financial opportunity worth investing in and pursuing aggressively You need a moral imperative to drive passion even when the revenues aren t rolling in I don t think that Intel and OLPC resolved their fundamental differences up front and it was only a matter of time before something dramatic happened "-- Scott Ferguson Do you have comments on this story

Six British civilians as well as 18 soldiers working in Afghanistan or Iraq may have been exposed to contaminated blood provided by the US military The British soldiers who were seriously wounded are now undergoing tests after it emerged that the Americans did not follow their own procedures and test the donors after they gave the blood The Health Protection Agency said the GPs of all six affected civilians had been informed But it admitted that because of the holiday period some of the GPs may not yet have informed their patients Those affected are being offered testing and counselling An HPA spokeswoman said: "The Health Protection Agency is aware that a small number of British individuals may have received a transfusion of unscreened blood as a result of life-threatening injuries received in Afghanistan or Iraq "The agency has advised the Ministry of Defence on the level of risk to those who may have been potentially exposed to infections as appropriate and is assisting with contacting some of the affected people " Story continues ADVERTISEMENT Haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after receiving contaminated blood in the late 1970s and 1980s described the blunder as an "absolute disgrace" Robert Mackie said it was "outrageous" that servicemen and women who risked their lives for their country had been put in this position He said: "Attitudes have not changed it is as simple as that Lessons have not been learnt It s an absolute disgrace to say the least " Defence Minister Derek Twigg said the 18 soldiers would "almost certainly" have died if they had not received an emergency blood transfusion at the front line While the risk of infection is "low" the matter is being taken "extremely seriously" he said The US Department of Defence said the American donors who provided the blood had now all tested negative for hepatitis and HIV But the British soldiers are still facing an agonising wait to learn the results of their own tests for blood infections Prime Minister Gordon Brown s spokesman said: "Of course this is a very serious matter and the Ministry of Defence are taking it very seriously "

currency hit a six-year low yesterday as the country s financial markets reeled in the violent and uncertain aftermath of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto The Karachi Stock Exchange s benchmark 100-share index plunged 694 92 points or 4 7% to 14 077 16 in its biggest single-day loss on the exchange s first day of trading after a three-day period of national mourning declared after Bhutto s death on Thursday The assassination also marked an end - at least for the moment - of Pakistan s brief period as a destination for adventurous investors amid fresh instability in an already volatile nuclear-armed nation advertisement Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack ahead of elections scheduled for January 8 throwing into doubt a smooth transition to civilian-led democracy after almost a decade of military-backed government under President Pervez Musharraf The killing unleashed street violence especially in southern Sindh province Bhutto s political stronghold and home to the country s biggest city and financial capital Karachi Mobs angry at Bhutto s death set fire to vehicles and railway stations prompting police to adopt a shoot-on-sight policy The violence and security crackdown paralysed the country shutting the stock market on Friday and freezing production As a rule investors hate political instability which threatens the security of their funds Bhutto had promoted policies that vitally for investors included a commitment to stamping out Islamic extremism in areas bordering Afghanistan As Pakistan began its return to life yesterday the sell-off began threatening to reverse an inflow of investment that had taken the stock market to record highs on the eve of Bhutto s death The KSE index still gained 40 2% this year making it the fourth-best performing stock market in Asia However turnover yesterday was the lowest for almost nine months The Pakistan rupee managed closely by the central bank fell almost 1% against the dollar to touch a low of 61 95 rupees its weakest level since October 2001 before suspected central-bank buying took it back to end at 61 55 rupees Analysts yesterday said investors were awaiting a decision on the timing

(CNN) -- An audio recording attributed to Osama bin Laden called on Europeans to abandon Afghanistan and accused NATO troops of killing women and children there The message surfaced on Al Jazeera television Thursday three days after al Qaeda s TV production unit promised fresh communication from the world s most-wanted terrorist leader "In this war you didn t respect the rules of war " the speaker says "The majority of the victims of your bombardments were women and children You targeted them and killed them on purpose You knew very well that our women don t fight but you targeted them even at weddings Your purpose is to demoralize the mujahedeen but this will do you no good " A U S counterterrorism official told CNN an intelligence community analysis indicates the voice is that of the Saudi exile and that the message appears to contain no specific credible threat CNN could not immediately verify the authenticity of the tape It includes references to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown who took office in June and French President Nicolas Sarkozy who was elected in May Watch what experts make of the new message The speaker also repeats his claim of sole responsibility for the September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington which killed nearly 3 000 people He says Afghanistan s Taliban militia which allowed al Qaeda to operate from the territory it controlled had no advance knowledge of the plot Don t Miss "I assure you that all the Afghans government and people were not at all aware of any of these events America is well aware of this fact Some of the Taliban ministers fell captive in their hands they were interrogated and they told the Americans the truth " he says Al Jazeera ran three excerpts from the message and the full length of the statement was not immediately known Bin Laden and Taliban leader Mohammed Omar escaped the U S invasion in 2001 and bin Laden was last thought to be hiding in the rugged mountains along the Afghan-Pakistani border U S and allied troops have spent six years battling remnants of al Qaeda and the Taliban with about 41 000 troops from the United States NATO and other countries taking part in the fighting Afghanistan is the largest ground operation in NATO s nearly 60-year history The speaker tells the allies that the American deployment will soon be withdrawn "by the blessing of God " "They will go back to their homelands beyond the Atlantic and they will leave the neighbors to finish off their interests among themselves " he says "It is better for you to address these issues with your politicians who are begging at the doorsteps of the White House and work hard on lifting the injustice on the oppressed Justice is the right thing to do; injustice is suffering " In Washington State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the tape sounded like old news He said Afghan children are receiving medical care and vaccinations that they would not have received before the ouster of the Taliban but "there is a lot more work to be done " "It s going to require a sustained commitment over a period of time and we have seen that kind of commitment from our European allies " McCormack said He added "I see no diminution in that level of commitment " The last message believed to be from bin Laden released in October urged Islamic jihadists loyal to al Qaeda in Iraq to join forces and remain loyal to the Islamic nation A September statement called on followers to launch a holy war against Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf who has launched a crackdown on Islamic militants in the border region since the collapse of a 2006 truce E-mail to a friend CNN s Octavia Nasr and Pam Benson contributed to this report All About Osama bin Laden Al Qaeda Afghanistan

London s News of the World reported However Paul L Doering professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Florida said Spears would not have been able to stand had she taken all those drugs and chased them with alcohol let alone make a phone call "I can tell you without hesitation that a human being could not ingest all of those drugs and still be on this planet " he told ABCNEWS com "The additive effect the combined toxicities the out-and-out poisonous properties of those things would send someone surely to the morgue rather than to the ER especially if swilled down with vodka or any other alcoholic beverage " Bipolar Britney While Spears drug and alcohol intake is up for debate her mental state is not Thursday s episode is the latest in a year-and-a-half-long binge of breakdowns which in 2007 included shaving her head bald and beating a car with an umbrella TV personality Dr Phil McGraw visited Spears in the hospital and told ETonline com that the meeting "convinced [me] more than ever that she is in dire need of both medical and psychological intervention " Though he had planned to air a special talking about Spears the television doctor said in a statement to "Entertainment Tonight" that he d decided to shelve it because her "situation is too intense at this time " According to People Spears bizarre behavior is the result of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder An unnamed source close to the Spears family told People "there is no question she is bipolar she s had manic episodes for years " Spears weekend activities may support that claim Though she was described as hysterical Thursday after checking out of Cedars-Sinai early Saturday the pop star went out to dinner with a photographer where she "seemed in a really good mood" and had a "champagne mimosa to drink " reported People magazine quoting the restaurant manager

The Phoenix Coyotes scored two power-play goals in the final 13 seconds of the second period to pick up a rare victory in Vancouver 4-3 over the Canucks on Friday night The key sequence began late in the second when the Jeff Cowan took exception to an aggressive hit by ex-Canuck Ed Jovanovski and tried to lure the defenceman into a fight Cowan was assessed a double-minor on the play which was made even worse a few seconds later when teammate Alex Burrows was given a delay of game penalty for putting his clearing attempt over the glass Jovanovski moved swiftly to capitalize on the 5-on-3 advantage firing a wrist shot past Vancouver goalie Curtis Sanford with 13 seconds remaining in the period Then with just three seconds to go and Phoenix still up two men fellow defenceman Keith Yandle wired a slapshot past Sanford from the top of the face-off circle "That was huge We talk about that all the time as a group " said Phoenix captain Shane Doan "We talk about controlling our emotions and putting the team first That was huge by Eddie He s a fiery guy with lots of emotion He is more than capable of taking care of himself but he chose in that situation to show restraint and it ended up getting us a power play " Jovanovski had already taken a couple of minor penalties in the game one of which led to the Canucks first goal "I know what he is out there for " said Jovanovski of Cowan "He s a very tough kid but we all know my history of injuries the last couple of years I m not going to fight him and break my hand I understand what he is doing but I ve also been told not to go out there and spend time in the penalty box "And you know what The refs already had it out for me today anyways " Vancouver coach Alain Vigneault benched Cowan for the rest of the game after the incident "It s not a matter of me being angry It s a matter of coaches and teammates being able to trust players in different situations That was a mistake and that s it " Vigneault said "I m pretty sure he would be the first one to tell you that that penalty is not acceptable And he didn t play after that " Peter Mueller and Niko Kapanen also scored for the Coyotes (23-19-1) who won for just the second time in their last 14 visits to GM Place while Ilya Bryzgalov made 17 saves Taylor Pyatt scored twice and Ryan Kessler added another for Vancouver (25-16-4) which failed to register a point for the first time in 15 home games Sanford made 34 saves in place of Roberto Luongo who got the night off after playing the previous night in San Jose and on Tuesday against the New York Islanders

Sunderland gave their Barclays Premier League survival hopes a major boost with a precious 3-1 victory over fellow strugglers Bolton Goals from Kieran Richardson on his return to the starting line-up and striker Kenwyne Jones saw the Black Cats race into a 2-0 lead with just 32 minutes gone However El-Hadji Diouf revived the visitors hopes when he pulled a goal back on 41 minutes and the home side had to hang on for dear life until Daryl Murphy s injury-time strike to claim just their second win in 14 attempts A timely intervention by Danny Collins denied Kevin Davies a free shot at goal from former Newcastle defender Andy O Brien s 10th-minute cross With 13 minutes gone Richardson found space on the left to run on to Jones inviting pass and smash a shot past Jussi Jaaskelainen Story continues ADVERTISEMENT Jones then ended his goal drought Richardson returned the favour with a well-placed near-post corner on 32 minutes and Jones did the rest with a bullet header to make it 2-0 Wanderers dragged themselves back into the game four minutes before the break Davies looked odds-on to convert Diouf s free-kick as it was allowed to travel across keeper Craig Gordon unhindered but although the striker failed to get a touch the ball crept inside the far post to reduce the deficit Keane replaced Michael Chopra before the break with Grant Leadbitter After the break Richardson ran on to Andy Cole s pass before unleashing a dipping drive which Jaaskelainen tipped over Wanderers began to apply pressure and went close on 61 minutes when Anelka curled a right-footed effort just wide At times the home side were camped inside their own penalty area but defended with an impressive resilience and got their reward when Murphy ran on to Jones flick on to finally kill Bolton off

Photo by Mark JonesAP Illinois senior linebacker J Leman deplanes at Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday The team arrived to prepare for the Rose Bowl against USC It is Illinois first Rose Bowl appearance since 1984 ANAHEIM So meet Illinois OK some of you are probably saying "I know Illinois It s that state next to Indiana the one where the motto is vote early and often That s where Chicago is " So let me be more specific: Meet the University of Illinois football team Now some of you are probably saying "They have a football team " As a matter of fact it does and it s in town this week to play USC in the Rose Bowl but your surprise is probably understandable After all it s been 24 years since the Illini that s the school s nickname by the way wandered out from Champaign (that s where the campus is located) to play in the Rose Bowl Since then every other Big Ten team has made at least one appearance except Minnesota and Indiana and Michigan s been here nine times for gosh sakes (Somehow the Wolverines even managed to win three times ) So the Illini are to say the least a fairly unfamiliar part of the annual New Year s football pageant None of the current players had been born the last time they were out here which is probably a good thing; they might have been scarred for life by watching UCLA maul Illinois 45-9 in the 1984 Rose Bowl What this means is that all the traditional aspects of Rose Bowl week which for locals are as routine as December temperatures in the 60s are new and exciting for Illinois They actually thought it was a big deal to go to Disneyland on Wednesday and are looking forward to tonight s beef bowl both of which are no more novel to USC s players than say text messaging But it also means you probably don t know a lot about the Illini particularly since it s been a few years since there was anything to know beyond well that they weren t very good Illinois is making its first bowl appearance of any kind in six years in the current bowl-for-every-city climate that s hard to do and during their five-year absence it was on the sidelines on merit Illinois went 13-47 in that time As recently as last year Illinois was 2-10 This year it is 8-3 which is good news and bad news The good news is that having emerged from five years of darkness the team is truly excited to be here and recognizes this is a chance to introduce itself to a lot of people "I think this whole season s been kind of a coming-out party " said running back Rashard Mendenhall "and for us to come here and cap it off with a good game against USC that would be a good end to our season " The bad news is well Rose Bowls aren t particularly kind to teams with three losses There have been six in 20 years and they re 0-6 Going all the way back to 1916 when Brown (5-3-1) came out to play Washington State and lost teams with three losses are 4-17 So history is against them What else do you want to know Well Illinois has a quarterback named Juice (Williams) a star linebacker who goes by the first name of J (Leman) as well a Dere (Hicks) and an Arrelious (Benn) And people think it s only the offspring of Hollywood celebrities have unusual names They also have a coach named Ron Zook which must come to some surprise to people down in Florida Before he came to Illinois Zook spent three years as head coach of the Gators where he was under fire practically from the moment he was hired the whole "fire(name of coach here) com" thing now a staple of disgruntled alumni everywhere may well have originated with Zook in Florida and was basically painted as the worst coaching hire south of Gerry Faust Yet here he is bringing Illinois to Pasadena which no Illini coach has done in 24 years and there have been three other guys who had the opportunity since Mike White did it in 1984 If any new Web sites are being created about him in Illinois it s to praise Zook not to bury him "Coach Zook established a vision for this program " said Leman that s right just J "and that was believing (it could be) a top-notch top-10 program He brought in fresh talent some of the best in the talent and he meshed that young talent with the old veterans He often said if you agree to become a team that s how good we ll be " Anyway you ll probably get to know a lot more details between now and game day but if you really wanted to understand what exactly Illinois is you only had to be at Wednesday s news conference featuring the Illini and USC during their visit to Disneyland While the media swarmed over Zook Williams Leman and three other Illinois player USC coach Pete Carroll sat for long periods without a single interviewer When the half-hour for interviews was up there were still reporters waiting to talk to the Illini; most of the Trojans had already taken off to ride the Matterhorn or the Teacups or whatever else struck their fancy So meet Illinois They re new and different at least on the Rose Bowl stage so don t be surprised if they get most of the attention from now until game time Come Jan 1 we ll see how they handle the attention Contact Star columnist David Lassen at dlassen@VenturaCountyStar com

Bynum injured as Lakers squeak by Grizzlies By Elliott Teaford Staff Writer Article Last Updated: 01/14/2008 01:49:16 AM PST The Lakers had already suffered one unexpected loss but Kwame Brown wouldn t let them endure another one Sunday night at Staples Center Brown missed a dunk with 9 2 seconds left but made one of two free throws after he was fouled to provide the Lakers with a 100-99 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies and a much-needed sigh of relief after Andrew Bynum was injured Bynum suffered a sprained left knee in the early minutes of the third quarter and could not return to the game X-rays taken during the game were negative but Bynum is scheduled to undergo an MRI this morning The Lakers will update his condition later today but Bynum will not play tonight against the SuperSonics in Seattle His status for Thursday s game against the Phoenix Suns at Staples Center was not immediately certain "I m not in too much pain only when I bend it " Bynum said as he walked from the arena after the game with a soft brace on his knee "I don t think it s serious at all " Brown will replace Bynum as the Lakers center tonight "Unless Wilt (Chamberlain) comes back from the dead I don t know what else we re going to do " Lakers coach Phil Jackson said wryly after the team s sixth consecutive victory The Lakers winning streak is their longest since they won 11 consecutive near the end of the 2003-04 season when they went to the NBA Finals They also have won 16 of their past 19 games to improve to 25-11 Kobe Advertisement Bryant scored 37 points for the second straight game to lead the Lakers He scored on a fastbreak to give the Lakers a 99-96 lead with 42 seconds remaining Rudy Gay countered with a 3-pointer to tie the score at 99-all with 32 seconds left Gay fouled Brown who attempted a dunk in the closing seconds Brown went to the free-throw line having made only 11 of 29 free throws this season (37 9 percent) His first try swished through the net but the second missed the mark "I was pleasantly surprised " Jackson said "I was prepared for that game to go the other way with all that has gone against us " Asked what he was thinking when Brown stepped to the line Jackson said "Make one Just give us the lead " The ending was something of an afterthought in the wake of Bynum s injury Bynum went down heavily clutching his left knee in obvious pain with 8:52 left in the third quarter He had jumped for a rebound but landed on teammate Lamar Odom s left foot and crashed to the floor as a sellout crowd of 18 997 fell silent The Lakers called for a timeout and all of Bynum s teammates plus the team s athletic training staff rushed onto the floor to check on him After a few moments Bynum tried to stand and walk off the court on his own He winced in pain before deciding he would need help Brown and Ronny Turiaf aided Bynum to the locker room as many in the crowd chanted his name Bynum had scored 10 points on 5-for-7 shooting and grabbed nine rebounds before he was forced from the game appearing to be well on his way to another superb performance He went into the game averaging 13 2 points and 10 2 rebounds The 20-year-old Bynum was coming off one of his best games in what has proven so far to be a breakout season He scored 25 points and grabbed a career-high 17 rebounds in Friday s 110-105 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks Jackson initially said he would reserve comment on Bynum s injury until after the results of today s MRI are announced He then said Bynum had suffered a knee injury when he was a child but that it had been his right knee As they had in Friday s win Bynum and Bryant formed a two-pronged attack in the first half Sunday against the Grizzlies Bryant strolled into the Lakers locker room a few minutes past 5 p m his voice a little rougher than usual but looking none the worse for wear after a bout with an upper respiratory infection that sidelined him for Saturday s practice

inflows through IPO route amid the central bank s bid to mop up overseas investments into equity market The central bank was not active during the day but is believed to be very alert and likely to

traders preferred to stay away due to fears of intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which seem ready to block the rupee s major surge a leader dealer with a private bank commented New high The central bank reportedly bought about $3 0 billion so far in the new year to cap the currency s rally to new high dealers added Meanwhile the RBI fixed the reference rate for the US currency at Rs 39 29 per dollar and for the single European unit at Rs 58 39 per euro The rupee premiums on forward dollar ended steady to firm on stray paying pressure from banks and corporates The benchmark

OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino speaks about the dangers of drinking and driving at a RIDE checkpoint on Monday Dec 31 2007 toronto ctv ca Police say enough is enough after two people were charged with drunk driving Sunday night despite a number of RIDE spot checks in the area Emergency crews were called to Highway 401 and Renforth Drive for a car accident When police arrived at the scene they found one of the drivers had allegedly left the scene Authorities eventually caught up with a suspect and charged him with impaired driving However while firefighters were attending the accident scene another car crashed into their firetruck That driver was charged with impaired driving as well He was sent to hospital with life-threatening injuries "We ve got two separate collisions here in the span of a half an hour involving alcohol " alleged Ontario Provincial Police Const Dave Woodford "There s far too many people dying on the highways " he told CTV Toronto "Enough is enough " A recent poll by the Ottawa-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation found that despite police spot checks on local roads drunk driving continues to be a problem in Canada More than 1 000 Canadians were polled in the study It concluded that the number of motorists who get behind the wheel after a few drinks has jumped almost three per cent in the last three years OPP Commissioner Julian Fantino responded to the study with an open letter to the community "With all the knowledge awareness education and exposure dedicated to the prevention of this particular crime Canadians have either tuned out the message or tuned themselves out of the problem in the misguided belief that the consequences of drunk driving will happen only to someone else " the letter said Fantino said police efforts to curb drunk driving are often diminished by the sentences imposed by the Canadian justice system and other loopholes "With regard to more meaningful consequences I strongly advocate the impounding of vehicles and the move toward administrative processes that will allow police officers the authority to employ a graduated scale of impoundment such as three months for a first offence six months for a second offence and so on " the letter continued "Drunk driving is the leading cause of criminal death in Canada - not guns or other weapons but rather the use of motor vehicle to kill people " it said Police will be out in full force on New Year s Eve doing spot checks as part of the RIDE program "We re going to be city-wide we re not just going to be on busy roadways we re going to be on obscure roadways to catch the people who want to take the back roads home " said Const Mig Roberts with Toronto Police Traffic Services told CTV Toronto There will be no excuse for drunk driving police say especially since the TTC has offered free rides for the first time in 30 years A ride on a TTC bus or subway will be free from midnight until 4 a m GO Trains are also free from 7 p m until service ends for the night Transit in Vaughan Mississauga and Brampton are also free New Year s Eve Woodford said if the public sees anybody driving erratically on the roads they should call 911 immediately to let them know "We can t be everywhere all the time and a lot of drivers try to avoid the police when they ve been drinking and driving " he said "If we get the help from the citizens then we can respond and hopefully get those people off the road " With a report from CTV Toronto s MairiAnna Bachynsky

Thousands of New Year s Eve revellers have taken to the streets of London to welcome in 2008 Partygoers were lining the streets of central London to take up prime spots in Trafalgar Square and the Embankment ready to watch the annual fireworks over the River Thames and hear Big Ben chime midnight To cope with the 350 000 to 400 000 people expected to celebrate in the capital 3 600 Metropolitan Police officers were on duty from uniformed officers to plain-clothes detectives Superintendent Andy Tarrant said he was confident that sufficient steps had been taken to keep the New Year celebrations in the capital under control "The crowds have doubled in the last three years but this year the number of police officers is commensurate with that so we are satisfied we will be able to accommodate and manage the crowds " he said Story continues ADVERTISEMENT "We have been planning for this event for almost 12 months and we have got in excess of 3 600 police officers on duty to make the evening as safe and crime-free as possible "We deal with a range of different offences ranging from drunkenness to theft If people do turn up intent on committing a crime our message to them is that they will be arrested and dealt with appropriately " Roads in central London started to close to traffic from around 6pm to deal with the influx of visitors and Mr Tarrant warned people to plan their journey home in advance Public transport in London will be free from 11 45pm to 4 30am to help revellers find their way back home

The Tasmanian government is under pressure to resolve allegations of bullying and sexual assault at a Launceston hospital following a report finding abuse complaints were ignored An independent investigator was called in to audit Launceston General Hospital s acute mental health unit - Ward 1E - after new claims of patient sexual abuse last June The report by Australian College of Mental Health Nurses president Peter Santangelo found complaints were either ignored or dismissed as trivial It also found staff had inconsistent views about what constituted a complaint or incident for review "Of particular concern were disclosures of sexual assault the subject of recent allegations which were reported to be either ignored or dismissed as trivial or unreliable because of the mental state of the client making the allegation " Mr Santangelo said in the report He said patients feared retribution if they reported abuse The audit is the second critical report on Ward 1E in three years It also exposed a culture of staff bullying led by a small powerful group of psychiatric nurses who were "resistant to change self-serving breached rules and regulations and ignored clients" "No one dares complain about them for fear of retribution " the report said Mr Santangelo found 22 of the 26 recommendations made in a 2005 report on 1E by the Health Complaints Commissioner had been implemented He made 38 further recommendations which Tasmanian Health Minister Lara Giddings has committed to adopt They include better complaints handling clinical supervision for staff and staff education and training in relation to workplace harassment policies Whistleblower and former mental health nurse Leila Rossiter said she was disgusted there had been two investigations in three years and the problem had not been resolved "It s absolutely soul destroying what s happening there " she told ABC Radio "I remember when it all came out a few years ago like trying to tell people that it was the tip of the iceberg and it s very disappointing to see that it s still happening at 1E " Tasmanian chief psychiatrist Ken Kirkby said progress was being made "Scrutiny is still on the ward making sure that programs are improving and staff are appropriately trained " he told ABC Radio "This external report by Mr Santangelo is part of that process - rather than sweeping things under the carpet we re making sure they re in full public view " AAP

Bradford could be 15m Olympic loser Coun Kris Hopkins Up to 15m could be snatched from Bradford s village halls and community groups to fund the London Olympics after a fresh raid on Lottery funds it was claimed yesterday Local authority leaders reacted with fury after an extra 675m was diverted from the National Lottery s good causes pot to pay for the 2012 Games The move means a total of 2 17bn of Lottery cash will now be spent on the Olympics - equivalent to 35 for every person in the country An alliance of local councils from across the North calculated that 77m would be lost from West Yorkshire meaning if evenly split between the five local authorities Bradford faces a potential loss of 15 4m And it warned that the victims would be grassroots voluntary groups and projects for whom the Lottery had offered a "lifeline" Among the projects typically funded by good causes grants are sports facilities and village halls and schemes helping disabled children and the homeless advertisement In the Commons it was claimed the raid was the equivalent of a sports pitch in every single parliamentary constituency Meanwhile the Government was forced to deny it faced a further 1bn blackhole in the 2012 finances after drastically underestimating the likely profits from land sales But despite the escalating row the Tories and Liberal Democrats stepped back from forcing a Commons vote on the 675m diversion Despite condemning the "financial incompetence" they backed the package in return for a strict pledge that there would be no further raids on Lottery cash Last night The Alliance - which represents 70 local councils in traditional industrial areas - said: "The Lottery has thrown a lifeline to small groups in some of the UK s most vulnerable communities These losses will directly impact on good causes throughout the UK with some of the areas of greatest need suffering the worst blows "There is a danger that the 2012 London Games could become deeply unpopular robbing good causes to pay for further investment in the country s most prosperous city " The Alliance demanded the Government reverse a previous pledge that London will enjoy the first claim on profits from the sales of Olympic land after 2012 But it is that funding stream at the centre of the alleged 1bn blackhole after a newspaper reported that sales were now predicted to raise 800m - not the original 1 8bn A shortfall would jeopardise the intention to repay to the National Lottery the 675m which is technically a loan Coun Kris Hopkins leader of Bradford Council said: "I believe the 2012 Olympics will be good for the country as a whole including Bradford district "However as I have said many times in the past it is scandalous that the Government has continued to raid Lottery funds to fund the Games "One of the selling points of the London bid was that the Olympics would serve as a catalyst for the regeneration of one of the city s poorest areas and that is fair enough "But any funds raised from the post-Games sale of Olympic facilities should clearly be used to benefit regions other than London which cannot expect to benefit twice to the detriment of areas in greater need " Posted by: sigil terminus on It is time lottery funding was clearly set out in advance so people know exactly what they are contributing to Those who claim Bradford will benefit from the Olympics dont seem to be able to say exactly how but the disadvantages are becoming more obvious as this story illustrates Posted by: Al Spade Bradford on I disagree with Kris Hopkins The Olympics will do absolutely nothing for Bradford and yet we are to lose over 15m to help fund it Did anyone ask if we wanted them They certainly didn t ask me!

By Nelson Bocanegra VILLAVICENCIO Colombia (Reuters) - A delicate mission to free three hostages held by Colombian guerrillas appeared to collapse on Monday as the government and rebel leaders accused each other of trying to kill the deal The Venezuela-led plan to pick up two women hostages and a child born to one of them in captivity has been repeatedly delayed since last Thursday and rebel leaders said intense army operations in the jungle region made it impossible for now "In these conditions it would put in grave risk the lives of these people to free them " the rebels said in a letter sent to Venezuela s left-wing President Hugo Chavez who had negotiated the deal for the release of the three hostages The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC promised earlier this month to deliver the three to Chavez and he sent two helicopters deep into Colombia last Friday to pick them up Chavez read out the FARC s letter explaining its failure to hand over the hostages and he accused Colombian President Alvaro Uribe of sabotaging his rescue plan "Uribe went to dynamite the third phase of this operation " Chavez said adding that independent reports also pointed to an intensification of Colombian military activity in the area Chavez said foreign envoys including former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner who are in Colombia to help the mission should now return home although he also vowed to continue working for the hostages release Uribe a conservative who has clashed repeatedly with Chavez denied military operations had prevented the handover Continued

A devastated hit-and-run victim has pleaded for help in catching the driver responsible after charges were dropped against a mentally ill Sydney cabbie who had confessed to the crime Speaking outside Sydney s Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday Jenny Franco - who lost an eye in the accident - described the dropping of the charges as "a kick in the teeth" "Someone out there in Sutherland Shire knows who really did try to kill me " she said flanked by her many supporters "Someone would have heard something seen something or known something in relation to this case "Have it in your heart and conscience to contact Miranda police urgently " Chief Magistrate Graeme Henson dismissed all charges against Stuart Russell Graham after a lawyer for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) sought to withdraw them Mr Graham 55 was charged with dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm and failing to stop and assist after a hit-and-run incident in Miranda on February 20 last year Ms Franco 23 was dragged 150 metres by what was described as a taxi resulting in her losing her left eye and spending months in hospital Outside court Mr Graham s solicitor Brett Thomas said he was certain the cabbie was not the driver of the vehicle involved "I am certain the police are certain the DPP is certain and that is why the matter has been withdrawn " he said Months after the accident Mr Graham - who suffers from schizophrenia - told police he was behind the wheel While it was not appropriate to go into the details Mr Thomas said the confession was related to issues associated with Mr Graham s mental health "We wish Jenny Franco well and her family well for her recovery and her future " Mr Thomas said "Finally we call on the person responsible for this terrible incident to come forward and explain what happened and take responsibility for their actions " He stressed it was not a situation where it was suggested Mr Graham committed the offence but because of his mental health the charges had been withdrawn "That is simply not the case his taxi wasn t involved he was not driving " he added In a statement the DPP said none of the objective evidence supported Mr Graham s confession and medical examinations revealed his accounts of events were unreliable "There was no physical evidence no DNA nor any eyewitness account connecting Mr Graham or his taxi with the incident " the director Nicholas Cowdery said "Indeed on the reliable and admissible evidence available it cannot even be proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was a taxi that struck Ms Franco " Ms Franco s aunt Zeny Hollebone called for public help in identifying the driver "The driver who hit dragged and left Jenny to die has to be charged and prosecuted " she said "Please I know there is somebody there who witnessed this accident please help the police " Mr Thomas said Mr Graham had not driven cabs since May and was "very much" receiving treatment for his illness He said he would be "very surprised" if Mr Graham was charged with hindering a police investigation Meanwhile acting NSW Opposition Leader Andrew Stoner said the Attorney General John Hatzistergos must explain why it had taken 11 months for the matter to reach its apparent conclusion "The victim her family and the general public were encouraged when this case went to trial but were apparently given false hope " he said "On the surface it would appear that justice for Ms Franco and her family is a long long way away " SPONSORED LINKS

Separatist rebels killed eight Thai soldiers and tried to decapitate them after ambushing a military convoy in the restive Muslim-majority south officials said Monday It was the single deadliest attack against the military in the region since June last year when seven troops were killed in an ambush of a security team protecting teachers In the latest incident a powerful bomb overturned the soldiers humvee in Narathiwat province and tore a one-metre (three-foot) crater in the road as they returned from escorting teachers to school Those who survived the blast were shot when they tried to escape according to Lieutenant Colonel Kannart Nikornyanont one of the top provincial military commanders Militants attempted to behead all eight soldiers They decapitated the top officer in the group and left the others with gaping stab wounds to the neck he told AFP "They cut off the head of one of the soldiers while the rest suffered deep wounds that left their heads partially severed " Kannart said The officer s head was left near the wreckage of the humvee with bodies and car parts strewn across the road Four soldiers travelling by motorcycle with the humvee managed to escape injury after a 15-minute gun battle Kannart said The attack happened at around 9:40 am (0240 GMT) in the Chanae district of Narathiwat one of three provinces along the Malaysian border that has been dogged by four years of separatist violence The convoy was part of a security detail that had escorted teachers to their school on Monday morning Kannart said Armed soldiers escort teachers to and from school every day in Thailand s south Educators are often targeted by militants who view teachers as symbols of Buddhist Thailand s domination of this Muslim and ethnic Malay region Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont said the latest deadly ambush was not an escalation in the conflict adding that it was instead a routine ambush with an unusually high number of victims "This kind of clash can happen any time It is not a serious escalation" of the conflict he told reporters "Authorities will have to investigate and not allow it to happen again " The southern region was an autonomous Malay Muslim sultanate until Thailand annexed it in 1902 provoking decades of animosity toward the state More than 2 800 people have died since the rebellion began in January 2004 with killings growing more frequent and brutal Former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra s heavy-handed tactics were widely blamed for exacerbating the unrest in Yala Pattani and Narathiwat provinces but he was ousted in a military coup in 2006 The generals and Surayud vowed to quell the insurgency with peace overtures to the rebels an apology over past abuses the reform of Islamic schools and tougher security Instead they watched as killings grew more frequent and brutal with both Buddhists and Muslims targeted every day An average of 72 people have been killed each month since the military took power in September 2006 sharply up from 53 deaths every month before the coup figures from independent monitoring group Intellectual Deep South Watch show The attacks have grown increasingly grisly in recent months with victims beheaded mutilated and even crucified in what analysts say is an attempt to spark a backlash and create divisions between Buddhists and Muslims In other incidents a roadside bomb hit another convoy of eight soldiers protecting teachers in neighbouring Yala province local police said Two of the troops were hurt in a subsequent five-minute gun battle Militants also set fire to three mobile phone towers and a telephone booth in a bid to disrupt communications around the region police said SPONSORED LINKS

TheStar com | News | Law professors MPs sign brief to free Khadr Law professors MPs sign brief to free Khadr Former attorney general Irwin Cotler among those asking Guantanamo judge to recognize him as child Jan 18 2008 04:30 AM michelle shephard national security reporter A group of law academics and Canadian parliamentarians have thrown their support behind a motion to recognize Omar Khadr as a child soldier and convince a Guantanamo Bay judge to dismiss his case Fifty-five law professors and 22 members of Parliament including Canada s former attorney general Irwin Cotler signed the legal brief that will be submitted today "It is a principle of customary international law that children are to be accorded special protections in all criminal proceedings and in any prosecution for participation in warlike acts " the brief states In a separate letter to Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier the lawyers urged the Canadian government to send a diplomatic note to the U S Department of State supporting their submission But when asked yesterday if a note would be issued Bernier s spokesperson Neil Hrab repeated the government s standard lines about Khadr s case in an email: "The Government of Canada has sought and received assurances that Mr Khadr is being treated humanely "Any questions regarding whether Canada plans to ask for the release of Omar Khadr from Guantanamo are premature and speculative as the legal process and appeals process are still ongoing " A spokesperson from the Department of Foreign Affairs emailed the same line The Pentagon maintains that while no one has been tried for war crimes allegedly committed under the age of 18 international law permits the prosecution of anyone over 15 The issue is likely to be debated next month when Khadr appears for a hearing at Guantanamo University of Ottawa law professor Craig Forcese said he is surprised the government has ignored the legal implications of the case "It s rather sobering that the Canadian government will readily intervene in a regular fair U S court process to protect a corporate or financial interest but will not intervene when a citizen s fundamental rights are jeopardized in a U S military commissions system that falls ridiculously short of international fair-trial standards " he said Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan after a lengthy firefight with U S Special Forces When he was first detained the Department of Foreign Affairs raised concern about his age in a press release from the office of then-foreign affairs minister Bill Graham: "It is an unfortunate reality that juveniles are too often the victims in military actions and that many groups and countries actively recruit and use them in armed conflicts and in terrorist activities " According to documents obtained by the Star under Access to Information legislation a week later Colleen Swords now head of the foreign affairs intelligence division wrote in an email new press lines must be written so as to "claw back on the fact that he is a minor "

Hockey finally returns the love to O Ree Friday will mark 50 years to the day that a rangy black kid from Fredericton New Brunswick donned a Boston Bruins sweater and broke pro hockey s color barrier on a sheet of ice in Montreal If you re lucky enough to catch 72-year-old Willie O Ree telling stories during the festivities the NHL and the rest of the hockey community has planned to commemorate the occasion listen closely Turns out he s got another tale about overcoming adversity that might be even better That s one reason I feel blessed O Ree said in a telephone interview from Boston where Saturday afternoon he ll be honored before a game against the Rangers I work with kids through my role with NHL Diversity and it s a chance to tell them If you really feel strongly enough about something you ll find a way to make it happen I guess that s why I d like to be remembered most for what I m doing now he added a moment later for giving back to the sport for everything it gave me The reason O Ree loved hockey more than it loved him at least until recently is because he made a comfortable joy-filled living playing left wing for 21 years nearly all of it in the minor leagues while almost nobody knew he was blind in his right eye O Ree was hit by a deflected shot playing in an Ontario junior league game some two years before his historic pro debut When he came to after an operation the first few words he heard couldn t have been more devastating The surgeon said my sight was gone and that I d never play hockey again O Ree said I was 19 going on 20 Everything I loved from the time I was a kid was about to disappear A month later though O Ree laced on a pair of skates determined to regain mastery over the things he could control and not worry about the rest Back then he chuckled nobody gave players eye exams They might look at your knees or how bruised the rest of you was but that was it Desire will take you a long way After patiently climbing the minor-league ladder O Ree got called up to Boston and ushered into Bruins general manager Lynn Patrick s office along with coach Milt Schmidt The conversation was brief and to the point They said We know you can play O Ree recalled Don t let anything you hear shake that belief History suggests even that brief conversation was unnecessary It was a decade after Jackie Robinson integrated baseball O Ree had already played in Montreal as a minor leaguer without incident and teammates fans and even opponents treated him respectfully His pioneering role in that Jan 18 1958 game seemed so unremarkable at the time that it didn t merit mention in most newspaper accounts the next day He stayed with the club for the return home game in Boston then went back to the minors not returning to Boston again until 1961 In all O Ree wound up playing only 45 games in the NHL But that s when his story got even more interesting The pay wasn t as good and the fans weren t as tolerant at some of the minor-league stops Playing in the old American Hockey League O Ree found himself in a few Southern towns where racism still wasn t muted At least he knew what to expect having spent a few weeks in Waycross Ga in 1956 trying out for baseball s Milwaukee Braves His favorite story from that experience was the bus ride back I got cut but I wouldn t have taken the job even if they d offered me one Whites-only this coloreds-only that I couldn t live that way he said When I got on the bus out I went right to the back and didn t get off except to use the bathroom or grab a sandwich But the farther north we went the more I moved up And by the time we got to the (Canadian) border O Ree said I was in the front seat Those memories weren t his only uncomfortable reminders In one arena fans threw a black cat on the ice; in others cotton balls They d yell things like You should be picking cotton O Ree said I wasn t going to yell back it was way too cold for cotton to grow where I was from But that would have been a waste of breath What O Ree did instead was concentrate on the things he could control He played long and well in several minor-league circuits and when the game s expansion took him to the West Coast he wound up settling in San Diego Ten years ago O Ree came out of semiretirement to become director of youth development for NHL Diversity The job puts him on the road a week each month teaching kids in three dozen locales how to play The life lessons deftly included are O Ree s The program already claims one NHL graduate goalkeeper Gerald Coleman While there are still less than two dozen players of color in one sense hockey is the most diverse big-time sport; players from 20 different countries make up a third of the NHL That tells O Ree the odds of making it to the big time are long enough no matter where you come from In some ways that s why his words resonate even stronger now than they did 50 years ago Just think about Willie s story commissioner Gary Bettman said from his office Thursday afternoon He d just returned from Fredericton where a rink honoring O Ree was dedicated First he breaks a sport s color barrier then plays pro hockey for 21 years with one eye then he sort of fades from people s consciousness then he s rediscovered And now he s using the game he s so passionate about and all that perseverance to touch 40 000 kids Now that the commissioner said is an incredible story = Jim Litke is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press Write to him at jlitke@ap org ( 2008 The Associated Press All Rights Reserved In the interest of timeliness this story is fed directly from the Associated Press newswire and may contain occasional typographical errors )

Bulls close in on Eddie Jones Friday 28th December 2007 The Bulls hope to have some clarity over the possible employment of former Australia coach Eddie Jones by next week Thursday The reigning Super 14 champions earlier this month expressed their interest in employing Jones as a backline consultant - to replace fellow Aussie Todd Louden - but the Pretoria-based franchise still needs to conclude negotiations with Jones s current employers English club Saracens The Bulls had hoped to finalise negotiations with Jones and Saracens - who will loan their man out to the South Africans on a consultancy basis - before Christmas but there has been a subsequent two-week delay in proceedings Bulls Chief Executive Officer Barend van Graan told rugby365 com on Friday that negotiations had been put on hold as Jones had left for Japan on rugby matters "I can t confirm what business he [Jones] is doing in Japan but we hope that he will be available next week " Van Graan told this website on Friday He added that further details would be released only once the negotiations were complete Should negotiations be successful Jones will consult alongside new Bulls head coach Frans Ludeke who was recently announced as Bok coach-elect Heyneke Meyer s successor in Pretoria Ludeke - who boasts a less-than-impressive record with the Lions at Super Rugby level - has a considerable amount of responsibility on his shoulders ahead of the new Super 14 season especially as the Bulls are the defending champions and outside expertise of any form would be most useful indeed Earlier this month Bulls Business Manager Ian Schwartz said the fact that many of the current Bulls had worked with Jones during his tenure as Springbok technical adviser played an influential role in the team s decision to pursue Jones Jones - who coached Australia to the RWC Final in 2003 - first joined the Boks for a three-week spell in South Africa before the 2007 World Cup but his impact so impressed coach Jake White and his back-up staff that he was signed on a short-term contract which included the Boks entire RWC campaign The Australian a former Super 12-winning Brumbies coach was sat next to White during matches throughout the entire tournament and was credited with transforming the South African backline into an effective force during the Boks triumphant World Cup campaign in France in September and October

Bush to Saudis: More Oil Please CBNNews com January 15 2008 CBNNews com - President Bush is urging OPEC nations to put more oil into the world market In Saudi Arabia today he told the world s largest supplier of oil that the rising price of crude is straining the U S economy Bush said he is speaking with Saudi King Abdullah about the situation that has seen the per-barrel price briefly top $100 this month and U S pump prices jump past $3 a gallon "Oil prices are very high which is tough on our economy " Bush said "I would hope as OPEC considers different production levels that they understand that if one of their biggest consumers economy suffers it will mean less purchases less oil and gas sold " The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries next meets Feb 1 in Vienna Austria to consider increasing output OPEC oil accounts for about 40 percent of the world s needs and OPEC ministers often follow the lead of the Saudis when deciding whether to increase production to take the pressure off rising prices The Saudis views carry significant weight because Saudi Arabia is responsible for almost one-third of the cartel s total output Saudi Arabia s oil minister says the kingdom will raise oil production when the market justifies it "Our interest is to keep oil supplies matching demand with minimum volatility in the oil market " Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters "We will raise production when the market justifies it This is our policy " Meanwhile the administration also notified Congress that it will be offering Saudi Arabia its "smart bomb" technology Some lawmakers fear that the technology could be used against Israel but Congress is unlikely to block the deal because of Saudi Arabia s cooperation in fighting terrorism and reigning in Iran Source: The Associated Press CBN IS HERE FOR YOU!

Newcastle were today closing in on their man as they stepped up efforts to lure Harry Redknapp to St James Park Redknapp did not attend Portsmouth s scheduled pre-match press conference leaving the club s training as the media gathered amid mounting speculation over the Magpies interest in him PA Sport understands the Tyneside club were preparing to formalise their interest in the 60-year-old today by making an approach to Pompey for permission to speak to him Neither club was either confirming or denying that contact has been made this afternoon However Redknapp s impromptu departure and the fact that Newcastle chairman Chris Mort was away from his desk - club owner Mike Ashley is currently in Hong Kong - added fuel to the fire as the former West Ham boss was backed down to an overwhelming 1/7 favourite with Ladbrokes Portsmouth moved quickly last night to make their position clear insisting Redknapp was happy where he was and committed to the club s future But the word from the south coast today was that there is a growing acceptance that his days at Fratton Park could be numbered amid rumours that talks over a compensation package are already under way Redknapp who was driven away from the training ground by chief executive officer Peter Storrie had earlier played his cards close to his chest re-iterating yesterday s insistence that he had heard nothing The manager whose side are due to head north to face the Magpies arch-rivals Sunderland on Sunday told the Portsmouth News: To say a deal has already been done is absolute rubbish I couldn t say anything else because that s the situation There has been no approach All I m doing is trying to get a couple of players in before the Sunderland game but I haven t got anywhere with that Nobody from Newcastle has contacted me and in any case that wouldn t be allowed Nobody has contacted Peter Storrie However the signs are that things have progressed rapidly since then with Newcastle hoping to install Sam Allardyce s replacement in plenty of time to make an impact in the January transfer window with Ashley ready to loosen the purse strings Tyneside woke this morning to read headlines suggesting Redknapp could be flown to and from his south coast home by private jet on a daily basis although that has been played down But events appear to have moved on significantly since then and the city is waiting with bated breath for further news The vacancy at St James has been described in some quarters as a poisoned chalice since Allardyce s demise but one of its former incumbents believes it is one of the biggest jobs in the domestic game Jim Smith a close friend of Redknapp said: Age is not a problem - Harry s a spring chicken Sir Alex Ferguson has got seven years on him and he is still going strong so there s no danger on that front I haven t spoken to him yet and it is a fantastic opportunity but it is a big ask Newcastle is a big club too It is one of the biggest jobs in English football - in fact it is one of the biggest jobs in European football It will be interesting to see what happens I don t know if Harry will go up to Newcastle It s a long long way from Bournemouth and Portsmouth are doing really well The thing is he is doing a really good job at Portsmouth and people will notice that Redknapp s favouritism saw Blackburn counterpart Mark Hughes slip in the betting after making a strong showing yesterday although he was quick to express his satisfaction with his lot at Ewood Park today He said: There is always speculation when any big job comes up I seem to be talked about in good terms and I m appreciative of that but it s just recognition of the work myself and my staff do here I have not spoken to anyone from Newcastle I spoke to my chairman last night and he has had no contact and I don t think there will be any contact In the meantime there is the little matter of the Magpies Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester United tomorrow evening with which to contend Coach Nigel Pearson has the task of preparing the team which left Tyneside this afternoon as they attempt to end a run of three successive league defeats He will at least have James Milner and Emre back from illness and an ankle injury respectively while Stephen Carr could rejoin the squad following a hamstring problem Your views on this story Email newsdesk@soccernet com Join the discussion on our Message Boards Club Pages Newcastle Portsmouth Adjust Font Size:

------------------------------------------------------------
Doin the FACTBOX review Cloverfield SHAWN LEVY The Oregonian Staff Friday January 18 2008 "Cloverfield" is an old-fashioned film with a newfangled shape It s a monster-comes-to-town movie -- you know "Godzilla " "King Kong " that sort of thing -- but it s composed like "The Blair Witch Project " of a videotape shot by the victims of the attack Like "Blair Witch " "Cloverfield" begins in a light tone and then takes us through a horrendous event in a make-believe version of you-are-there real time It s a little craftier than that -- there s a framing tale that compels some of the actions our protagonists take -- but by and large it s like a very long YouTube version of the worst day ever complete with shaky framing interrupted shots and a cameraman frequently screaming in terror of what he s filming The tape discovered in what a title card refers to as "the area formerly known as Central Park " chiefly records a spring night in lower Manhattan Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is about to leave for a job in Japan so his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and Jason s sweetie Lily (Jessica Lucas) are throwing him a going-away party Hud (T J Miller) another of the gang is deputized to film the partygoer s farewells to their friend Booze music hotties of both genders: good times good times The one latecomer is Beth (Odette Yustman) a pillar of the gang who s been out of touch in recent weeks As we in the audience know because we ve seen the beginning of the tape Rob and Beth have slept together -- apparently a big deal in their circle During the party right in front of Hud s prying video eye this secret spills into the open and quarrels and recriminations ensue And then the thing happens We re a mile or so from ground zero remember so when a tremendous boom shakes the building and fires are visible from the roof and debris comes screaming through the air everybody runs down to the street -- where they re met with the sickening sight of the head of the Statue of Liberty falling among them like a discarded apple core In the mayhem Hud has captured an image of a gigantic something and watching buildings collapse and feeling the earth shake everybody is convinced that Manhattan is no place to be And then Beth manages to call Rob and announce that she needs help and Rob decides to tempt whatever it is that s out there to go find her And he and the rest find a very nasty thing -- several very nasty things actually -- between themselves and safety For a short film with a no-name cast and a B-movie premise "Cloverfield" has some truly fiendish ways of getting under your skin Obviously there s a massive Sept 11 allegory at work with Manhattan once again the target of a bloody and random attack But there s the sly twist too that it s a relationship movie: have sex with one of your chums it tells us with a wink and there s no telling what kind of ill mood will arise amid your merry gang And then there are the critters (Close your eyes for the rest of this paragraph if you don t want to spoil the surprise ) Director Matt Reeves uses the venerable method of only gradually revealing his monsters which turn out to be a really big one that looks like some kind of nuked-up chameleon and a lot of crab-like little ones that fall off big boy like dandruff and glom onto people with vicious speed This combination of meanies is a little curious (and not exactly fair play on the monsters part let s be honest) but it allows Reeves to stage both big battles (Army vs gigantic monster) and little skirmishes (our heroes vs the crab thingies) and to alternate between wide-open spaces (the Brooklyn Bridge Central Park) claustrophobic spaces (subway tunnels) and frightening make-believe spaces (a pair of high-rise buildings collapsed against one another) In the midst of all this mayhem and choppy photography -- you might wish you d mixed in a Dramamine with your popcorn -- acting isn t really a priority But Miller is agreeably clownish behind the camera (which ironically means we see him least) and Lizzy Caplan is continually interesting as a girl who accidentally joins our little band and continually reveals new strengths and resources "Cloverfield" isn t quite the smack to the brain that "Blair Witch" was but it s a sharp and vivid film filled with moments of tremendous ingenuity and characterized by a persistent avoidance of the expected tropes It s far scarier than the big-budget remakes of "Godzilla" and "King Kong " more engaging than "I Am Legend " more human than a sackful of slasher films But if that makes it sound like something you ve seen before rest assured that you haven t

The issue Dodi and Di s relationship The official account They d only recently met and it was at the time of their death just a summer romance The Stevens report a year ago said: "She was not about to get engaged " The Fayed version They were deeply in love were about to announce their engagement and she was pregnant with his child What the inquest has been told She sent Dodi her beloved late father s cufflinks and after their cruise wrote to him: "This comes with all the love in the world and as always a million heart-felt thanks at bringing such joy into this particular chick s life " CCTV footage shows the couple cuddling at the Ritz just before leaving on the fatal journey Diana s stepmother Countess Spencer (a Harrods director) said the Princess was "deeply and blissfully" in love with Dodi but Rosa Monckton a Diana confidante doubted this Frank Klein Ritz president said Dodi called him two weeks before the crash and said he was going to get engaged The jury has been shown a receipt for an 11 600 ring from the Alberto Repossi store which contains the words "engagement ring" There has been no evidence that Diana was party to the purchase Ten days ago Claude Roulet former assistant president of the Ritz said Mr Repossi s account was an invention He added that when he questioned Mr Repossi s version Mr Klein told him to "shut up" Dr Robert Chapman who carried out Diana s post-mortem examination said there was no evidence that she was pregnant Ms Monckton said that only 10 days before her death Diana had had a period Our verdict Their true feelings will never be known but Diana s track record with lovers suggests a certain lack of constancy There is not the remotest chance that she was pregnant The issue The threats to Di The official account Widespread stories instigated by Diana that she feared an "accident" would be arranged have been put down to her volatile mental state verging on paranoia The Fayed version He believes she felt threatened The Royal Family was so determined to stop the mother of a future king giving birth to the child of a Muslim that it was prepared to kill her What the inquest has been told There has been no direct evidence of any threats to Diana A friend Simone Simmons said that Diana had asked her to listen in to a phone call made in February 1997 and she heard a voice resembling that of then armed forces minister and former equerry to Prince Charles Nicholas Soames warn Diana that "accidents can happen" Last week Mr Soames described the claim as "grotesque" The Princess seemed an avid collector of conspiracies The jury was told that Diana once informed her lawyer she was convinced the Queen would abdicate and Charles would abandon Camilla Parker Bowles and make royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke his consort Michael Gibbins her former private secretary said that in the months before her death Diana changed her phone number because she was convinced her calls were monitored Asked about the Princess s attitude to seatbelts Mr Gibbins said she always wore one Asked whether there was royal disapproval of her lovers Mr Gibbins said "Not directly but by inference certainly " These gentlemen were named last month as James Hewitt James "Squidgygate" Gilbey art dealer Oliver Hoare Will Carling and bodyguard Barry Mannakee Our verdict Monitored calls have a certain ring of truth but threats are more likely the product of a fevered imagination And if she feared an arranged "accident" why did she not wear a seatbelt The issue Henri Paul The official account His alcohol intake (three times over the drink-drive limit said police) and reckless driving caused the fatal accident The Fayed version Paul as acting head of security at the Paris Ritz had been a trusted Fayed employee but was in the pay of British and French intelligence What the inquest has been told The coroner said right at the start that it was unclear if Paul was unfit to drive through drink or drugs and also if such evidence did exist whether it had been concocted S bastien Trotte former barman at the Ritz said that he served Paul with two 4cl measures of Ricard an aniseed spirit drink of 45 per cent proof He added that the acting security head who was sitting with bodyguards waiting for Dodi and Diana to be ready to leave did not seem "in any sense drunk" However he had other opportunities to drink that night and was entitled to think for most of that time that he was off duty and would not be further required The jury also heard that this "modestly paid" man had 170 000 in his bank account and on the night he died 1 200 in his pocket Our verdict It has not yet been proved that Henri Paul was drunk but more evidence may emerge If he was part of a plot why did he not wear a seatbelt And where did all his cash come from The issue The crash The official account The black Mercedes S280 driven by Henri Paul was going too fast (60-63mph at impact) and Paul lost control The Fayed version Henri Paul was not drunk and the blood tests that "proved" this had been switched or tampered with by MI6 The crash had been plotted by the British establishment What the inquest has been told Accident expert Tony Read told the court that the crash was probably caused by Henri Paul s "overreaction" in trying to avoid a white car presumed to be a Fiat Uno He said Paul swerved left right then left again at between 60 and 70mph Mr Read said that tyre marks left on the road showed that the Merc and white car had glancing contact just outside the tunnel It was not clear if the white car had been ahead of the Mercedes or was emerging from a slip road when the two vehicles touched Mr Read dismissed suggestions that the accident was planned and also the idea from Mr Fayed that there was a bright "flash" in the tunnel which fleetingly blinded or distracted Paul In his view the factors were: Paul s alcohol intake the high speed at which he was driving the distraction of the paparazzi and the high adrenalin situation Asked if Dodi and Diana would be alive today if they had been wearing seatbelts Mr Read replied: "I think we can almost guarantee it would be survivable " Our verdict It seems certain that at least one other vehicle was involved It is highly unlikely that Paul had drunk enough to be swerving all over the road without some external cause The issue The Fiat Uno The official account Widely believed to be mythical but this vehicle was said by Lord Stevens to have been in contact with the Mercedes just before entering the underpass The Fayed version The Fiat driven by paparazzo James Andanson in the pay of MI6 was part of the ambush His Fiat Uno and another car forced the Mercedes to lose control What the inquest has been told Two witnesses said they saw a "light-coloured hatchback" driving slowly into the tunnel One of them Nathalie Blanchard said it was "something like an Austin Mini or Fiat Uno" One witness James Huth who had lived by the tunnel for 20 years said: "I cannot think why a car driving that fast would have to brake at that point unless there was something in its way " Georges Dauzonne told the court that he saw a white Fiat Uno coming out of the tunnel driven slowly by someone looking in his rear-view mirror apparently "bothered" by something behind him He said the car stopped by the side of the road before pulling away again Shown photographs of possible drivers of the Uno Mr Dauzonne and his wife both picked out French security guard Le Van Thanh who has refused to testify at the inquest Mr Fayed believes that the driver was French photographer James Andanson who he says was part of the plot to kill Diana The Stevens report concluded that Mr Andanson who committed suicide in 2000 was at home with his wife at the time the crash took place Our verdict The Uno seems a major contributory cause of the crash But who was driving it Some hesitant unknown A secret agent Or someone linked to the paparazzi Best guess: Mr Van Thanh was at the wheel The issue Di s hospital treatment The official account Lord Stevens said: "The surgeons did everything humanly possible" to save the lives of those involved The Fayed version The medical treatment of the Princess both at the scene and in hospital was flawed and she was embalmed to disguise signs of her pregnancy What the inquest has been told One of the first witnesses to reach the scene said the Princess was trapped in the car s footwell and partly obscured by Dodi s body She appeared to have been sitting sideways on to Dodi at impact Witnesses said she was agitated and said "Oh my God" several times She resisted treatment at the scene pulling a drip from her arm At 1am as she was taken out of the wreck her heart stopped but was started again by cardiac massage The ambulance went at only a modest speed because of her condition A short distance from the hospital her heart stopped again and the ambulance halted to allow her heart to be again restarted Once in hospital a tube was inserted in her throat to allow her to breathe but constant cardiac massage was need to keep her alive as doctors tried to clamp a ruptured blood vessel near her heart Her chest was opened up and she was given repeated electric shocks but she died A dissenting voice on her treatment came from British surgeon Professor Thomas Treasure who told jurors that "opportunities were lost" because of the lengthy time that Diana was treated at the scene and in the slow journey to hospital The court heard that the embalming (normally carried out only when a body reaches Britain) was done because of the heat and because "security" meant Diana could not be transferred to a refrigerated mortuary The embalmers referred to her as "Patricia" Our verdict One surgeon told the court there are only four or five cases of someone with Diana s injuries surviving Yet the "security" excuse in relation to the refrigerated mortuary is not convincing The issue The Duke of Edinburgh and an MI6 plot The official account It is inconceivable that such a plot would exist Diana and the stories she inspired was an irritant rather than any threat to the Royal Family The Fayed version So determined were the royals to remove Diana and her unborn Muslim child that Prince Philip orchestrated British intelligence in killing her and her lover by forcing their car to crash What the inquest has been told Frank Klein of the Ritz said Mohamed al-Fayed s first reaction was to claim the crash had been arranged In a call 20 minutes after the crash Mr Fayed said: "Frank this is not an accident This is a plot or assassination " One witness Fran ois Levistre gave evidence that will be seized upon by conspiracists He said he was driving in front of the Mercedes which was overtaken by a motorbike He said a bright flash was aimed at the Mercedes and he then saw in his rear-view mirror the Merc veer from side to side crash and the motorbike passenger get off look inside the Mercedes gesture to his driver and speed off Mr Levistre said he stopped but did not want to get out of his car "I thought they were hit-men " he added Another witness S v rine Peyret said she heard the crash and then a motorbike sped past at "great speed" A third said he also saw a flash The then number two at the British embassy Keith Moss said he believed British intelligence had a base in Paris This was for counterterrorism and organised crime duties Mr Moss said the embassy had not known Diana was in Paris that day Our verdict Mr Fayed made up his mind before any detail was known There is no evidence of intelligence involvement and at least some of Prince Philip s correspondence with Diana suggests affection rather than homicidal rage The issue The paparazzi The official account These were not nice people and they were harassing Dodi and Di that night but they were not the direct cause of the accident The Fayed version At least one of the paparazzi was in the pay of MI6 but the photographers were not to blame for the crash What the inquest has been told The paparazzi were hyper that night as rumour spread among them that Diana was about to announce her pregnancy or engagement One witness said the Mercedes was "hindered" before the crash by paparazzi on motorbikes Several witnesses say photographers stood outside the car and even on it taking pictures before opening the door to offer help Another Olivier Partouche said that as he stood on the approach to the tunnel he saw a dark car trying to slow down the Mercedes so paparazzi just behind on the motorbikes could remain in photographic range He described the dark saloon as "a blocking car" Another Ga lle Lhostis also saw a dark car possibly a Renault Clio being driven slowly and "hindering" the Merc One paparazzo Romuald Rat (pronounced to rhyme with "car") offered pictures of the injured Princess inside the crashed Merc for 300 000 The Sun said yes "in principle" Some of the pictures of the dying Princess were shown to the jury but will not be released to the public Our verdict If there had been no paparazzi and Paul had not overreacted to them and the other vehicle in the tunnel there would almost certainly have been no crash and there s still four months to go!

The death of winemaker Trevor Drayton and the destruction of a key section of his family s Hunter Valley winery in a massive explosion will not stop preparation of the Draytons latest vintage John Drayton said the family - regarded as pioneers of the region s winemaking industry - were still in shock after the blast that killed his older brother about 8 30am (AEDT) on Thursday Trevor 52 and another man understood to have been a welding contractor died in the blast at Drayton s Family Wines at Pokolbin Assistant winemaker William Rikard-Bell 27 survived but with burns to 80 per cent of his body "Naturally we are still in shock at our loss but we have also been very touched by the community and public support which we have received " Mr Drayton said in a statement "We extend our thanks to police fire brigade ambulance officers and especially the Westpac rescue helicopter "Their professionalism and sensitivity has been outstanding " Mr Drayton also extended his condolences to the family of the second man killed in the blast and added that the family held high hopes for Mr Rikard-Bell s recovery "We are also very conscious of the loss of another life in this tragedy and my family s thoughts are with his loved ones " he said "We understand that the condition of our outstanding young winemaker Will Rikard-Bell is improving and we are hopeful of a full recovery for him " Mr Rikard-Bell remains in a stable condition at Sydney s Concord Hospital The 150-year-old business is one of the original wineries in the Hunter region and will continue its long-standing traditions Mr Drayton said "As for the future - our family has a long and proud heritage in the Hunter grape growing and winemaking industry and it is our intention that this will continue " A fellow winemaker who asked not to be named said Mr Drayton met with at least five other vineyard owners on Friday to work out how they would assist Drayton s with the processing of their grapes Keith Tulloch of Keith Tulloch Wines was unable to make the meeting but he said the Pokolbin community and its 15-odd wineries would help Drayton s to ensure the harvest went ahead "People in the area will do all they can to assist the Drayton family in their processing of this vintage " Mr Tulloch told AAP "It is simply a heartfelt belief that the community will pull together and we ll assist the Drayton family in any possible way that we can " Mr Tulloch said the harvest would extend from this month to early March with some grapes already picked for processing He also said the police investigations and the damage caused by the blast would probably prevent the Draytons from getting their processing facility back online in time for this harvest The National Wine and Grape Industry Centre (NWGIC) at Charles Sturt University praised the work of Mr Drayton and offered condolences to his family "Mr Drayton was a highly respected leader of the Australian wine industry who will be sadly missed by all that knew and worked with him " NWGIC director Thomas Henick-Kling said in a statement "His knowledge and experience was a wonderful resource for the national wine industry " Police are yet to confirm reports that welding work had ignited ethanol fumes within the plant A police spokeswoman said forensic investigators entered the site on Friday morning to investigate the cause of the blast SPONSORED LINKS

Seattle Washington Andrew Morton Cruise biographer defends controversial book Andrew Morton who wrote an unauthorized biography on Tom Cruise is interviewed by the Associated Press Tuesday Jan 15 2008 in New York Story Published: Jan 18 2008 at 8:29 AM PST By Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) - Andrew Morton author of "Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography " published by St Martin s Press alleges that the 45-year-old actor ranks second in command in the Church of Scientology The book which came out this week also alleges that some Scientologists believe that Cruise s daughter Suri was conceived using frozen sperm from Scientology founder and science fiction writer L Ron Hubbard In a statement to The Associated Press Cruise s lawyer Bertram Fields said Wednesday that Morton s book is "absolutely loaded with false statements" and "Mr Morton should be ashamed of himself for telling such vicious lies about a child to hype sales of his book "The church has responded with a 15-page statement calling the book "a bigoted defamatory assault replete with lies" and saying Cruise "is a Scientology parishioner and holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy "The 54-year-old Morton who has written books about Princess Diana David and Victoria "Posh Spice" Beckham Madonna and Monica Lewinsky talked about his book in an interview with the AP Some highlights;AP: Why Cruise Morton: When I saw him jumping on Oprah s couch in 2005 I realized the mask had slipped Here is this man who for years has been in control and controlling He s been hiding behind the mask I thought here is a window to get an insight into this man who has come from nowhere to become one of the dominating characters in the film world and elsewhere AP: Did you ask Cruise to be interviewed for the book Morton: I asked Tom for an interview and he declined The Church of Scientology has got a very controversial reputation and that is what he is linked with An unauthorized biography would essentially be a compromise I want to investigate it without any kind of fetters AP: Rogers & Cowan the publicity firm that represents Cruise issued a statement criticizing Morton for not interviewing "one person who has known or worked with Tom" in the past 25 years Is that true Morton: Well I ve been working on this for the last two years I interviewed everyone from scriptwriters to producers to actors to actresses to teachers to girlfriends to pupils to Scientologists to people who have audited him AP: There have been reports that you were threatened by Scientologists while making this book Morton: In fairness to them (Scientologist) they haven t harassed me They have sent threatening legal messages as they are entitled to do AP: Cruise s lawyer Bertram Fields says this book is "packed with lies " What is your response Morton: I ve got a reputation as a very careful biographer I have spent over two years carefully researching this book I think I presented a very fair and balanced portrait of an intriguing and fascinating character AP: How do you view Cruise Morton: I see him as a man who is linked to his faith of Scientology someone who has transcended his role as a film star to become a Hollywood powerhouse and also someone who walks the corridors of power meets presidents and prime ministers AP: You say in your book is that Cruise is second in command at the Church of Scientology What evidence do you have Morton: Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today if it had not been for the involvement of Tom Cruise He has been the poster boy More than that he has been recruiting fellow celebrities - people like Will Smith Jada Pinkett Smith More than that he s been the frontman for the organization Not just bringing people in but seeing all the politicians the movers and shakers in society to proselytize for his faith In a way he has also compromised himself as an actor by some of his behavior and some of his attacks for example on Brooke Shields for taking drugs for postpartum depression That alienated a lot of his fans especially women What happens when they try to recruit It is not like here s a leaflet sign up It is a slow and gradual process that could take a number of years In order to give his faith some respectability they always feel that if you get celebrities in it brings people in I ve lost count of the number of people I ve spoken to former Scientologists who have said to me I joined because I thought if it is good enough for Tom Cruise if it is good enough for John Travolta then it is good enough for me AP: Some of your critics say that you only interviewed disgruntled former Scientologists and not any practicing Scientologists for the book Morton: I interviewed Scientologists who have left They are not necessarily disgruntled They are people who have spent half their lives in the organization reaching very high levels both of personal achievement and within the executive branch It s not that they all have an ax to grind They ve all got an insight into what goes on there and Tom s involvement in the cause AP: You also say in your book that Scientology is to blame for Cruise and Nicole Kidman s break up Morton: What happened is that Nicole started to pull away from Scientology She said in an interview that there was a little bit of Scientology in her a little bit of Buddhism but also Catholicism That sent alarm bells ringing inside Scientology and Tom was sent in and took this course which is called a PTSSP course which is to basically anchor yourself to the faith and to treat the outside world with more suspicion because it is a self-contained cocooned world You become more distant from the people who no longer believe in you who no longer believe in the faith and one of those was Nicole Kidman Having said all that when Nicole was sitting after the break up and sobbing into her handkerchief and saying to her friend "Why did he leave " She had no real answer She was always seen as somewhat of a problem because her father is a psychiatrist and Scientologists loathe psychiatry AP: Does Katie Holmes have a contract with Cruise Morton: I think in a way there is a parallel between her story and that of Princess Diana Diana was enamored with Prince Charles when she was a schoolgirl she had his picture on the wall and was telling her school friends that one day she would marry him Similarly with Katie she used to tell her sisters that one day she would marry Tom Cruise When she was on the set of "Dawson s Creek " she was teased mercilessly because she had this crush on Tom Cruise When she met him he had her at hello Very soon afterward she found herself alienated from her friends She found herself surrounded by Scientologists She got rid of her manager She got rid of her management Observers who interviewed her at the time used to call her deadeye Katie The reason why that was significant is because she got her job as Joey on "Dawson s Creek" in the first place because of her incredible eyes because of the life and sparkle in her eyes It seemed to people who were interviewing her at the time that she changed and changed significantly This content requires the latest Adobe Flash Player and a browser with JavaScript enabled Click here for a free download of the latest Adobe Flash Player KOMO Weather Current Temp 39 F 39 F Partly Cloudy Wind : From the North at 13 MPH From the North at 13 MPH Humidity : 76 % 76 % Pressure : 30 07" (1019 2 mb) 30 07" (1019 2 mb) More Weather Traffic More Traffic KOMO News Alerts Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop Watch ABC Shows Watch ABC shows and news online free!

THE A-League must be going places - so much so that a small Norwegian club has been accused of trying to steal Sydney FC s badge At the start of this month a new team was established to represent the city of Sarpsborg some 100km south of the capital Oslo and close to the Swedish border Attempting to recapture the halcyon days of Sarpsborg FK who won six Norwegian league and cup titles before a long period of decline since the 1970s the local football community effectively took over the club which is struggling against relegation in Norway s second division The new team an amalgamation of 16 amateur clubs took a new name SFK Sparta But here s the catch: they needed a new badge as well A local designer Ben Host was put to work and produced the emblem shown above Swap the turrets for the Opera House and bingo! Within days word filtered back to Norway that the badge bore a striking resemblance to Sydney FC s The national newspaper Sarpsborg Arbeiderblad has drawn the comparison and opened a blog for comment Most of it doesn t reflect well on the designer who insists he knew nothing about Sydney FC The new club s board has taken him at his word and says it will be sticking with the logo Sydney FC chief executive George Perry said: "It s an absolute corker It s more than a striking similarity it s basically a mirror image " Graphic designer Paul Rhodes who created the Sydney FC logo added: "It s evolution to suit the brand but basically it s direct plagiarism The annoying thing is that it s being used in the same sport and that s confusing because Sydney FC is becoming a global brand " Sydney FC are deciding whether to take any action in tandem with Football Federation Australia which owns the copyright to all the A-League badges An FFA spokesperson said: "We re investigating we ve spoken to Sydney FC and we re going to support whatever they might want to take " Meanwhile officials from the FFA and Sydney FC together with police and Sydney Football Stadium security have decided to take extra precautions before Sunday s crunch match against Melbourne Victory Pre-sales are tracking towards a record regular-season crowd of more than 25 000 and after clashes between rival fans in the two previous matches this season the club does not want to take any chances Asked if Melbourne fans were welcome at the SFS Perry replied: "All fans are welcome as long as they behave themselves All indications are for a big crowd and we don t want any nasty surprises There will be increased security but again it s incumbent on all fans to do the right thing "

Niners hire Martz to turn offense around AP Sports Writer Mike Martz claims he can put together a fantastic offense with mostly the same San Francisco 49ers who made up the NFL s worst unit in 2007 It s just the type of brash confidence everybody expects from Martz - and Mike Nolan believes every word of it Nolan hired Martz to be his offensive coordinator Tuesday tasking one of the NFL s most polarizing coaches with reinventing an offense that sank to historic lows last season Martz has been on a rocky coaching road for the past three years but he tormented the 49ers for six years during his greatest successes with their NFC West rival St Louis Rams Martz built the so-called Greatest Show on Turf over seven seasons honing a remarkable passing game while the Rams reached two Super Bowls After the Detroit Lions fired him last week following two seasons as their offensive coordinator Martz - who coached alongside Nolan in Washington a decade ago - jumped at the chance to resurrect the franchise that redefined offensive football in the 1980s under Bill Walsh "There are a lot of really outstanding pieces there that we just need to tie together " Martz said "If we can do that they re so well-established in special teams and on defense I think the potential and the opportunity there is pretty exciting It s not a challenge it s an opportunity and that s the part I enjoy " Martz sees boundless promise in a San Francisco offense built around talented running back Frank Gore who reminds him of Marshall Faulk Of course Martz also inherits an undistinguished offensive line a weak receiving corps and a burgeoning quarterback controversy He didn t even blanche at taking a job with Nolan whose job could be in jeopardy if the 49ers post a sixth straight losing season in 2008 "You ve got to remember I ve been on the hot seat too " said Martz who has been fired twice in just over two years "I believe that I have such a great feel for who Mike is In this league it s a year-by-year proposition anyway " Nothing frightened Martz about replacing Jim Hostler who also was fired last week after the 49ers finished last in the NFL in points (219) total yards (3 797) yards passing (2 320) offensive touchdowns (23) first downs (218) sacks allowed (55) and third-down conversions (31 4 percent) Martz who got a two-year contract is San Francisco s sixth offensive coordinator in six years The 49ers didn t disclose Martz s salary but he would have made $2 million in Detroit next season - and that s more than the 49ers pay Nolan who has two years left on a five-year $8 million deal While making his name in St Louis Martz became known for a confidence that often borders on arrogance - a quality that s also been cited in Nolan He interviewed only one other candidate - former Dallas and Georgia Tech coach Chan Gailey - before hiring Martz "There s no one more creative as far as using personnel that allows us to be productive on offense " said Nolan who will return for a fourth season despite a 16-32 record "He s got one of the best minds in all of football Mike was about as excited as I ve seen him and certainly excited about a lot of our players " Nolan and Martz were together on the Washington Redskins coaching staff from 1997-98 with Martz coaching the quarterbacks while Nolan was the defensive coordinator It s difficult to tell how Martz s style will mesh with the 49ers whose only reliable offensive skill has been Gore s rushing The Lions finished 32nd and 31st in the NFL in yards rushing while Martz concentrated on his inventive passing attacks - but Martz said he didn t have a player like Gore who compares favorably to former MVP Faulk "I think you can put him as the centerpiece and build around that " Martz said "Frank is a little bit bigger more physical but he has the receiving skills he s an unselfish pass-blocker and he s really a complete player that really shouldn t come out of the game That s hard to find in this league anymore " The 49ers have perhaps the NFL s least impressive collection of receivers with starters Darrell Jackson and Arnaz Battle backed up by Ashley Lelie and rookie Jason Hill Tight ends Vernon Davis and Delanie Walker often were underutilized And while Alex Smith heals his rift with Nolan over the treatment of the quarterback s shoulder injury he ll also have to adjust to his fourth new offensive scheme in four NFL seasons - if he even wins the starting job The 49ers hope to re-sign former third-stringer Shaun Hill who led the 49ers to victories in his first two NFL starts last month "There s great potential there " Martz said "They re both accurate and I think Alex watching him through the year is very impressive " Nolan will fill the rest of his coaching staff with input from Martz but the 49ers already have dropped three of Hostler s assistants Martz seems inclined to keep receivers coach Jerry Sullivan and offensive line coach George Warhop praising both veteran coaches Tuesday Ted Tollner the veteran coach who came on late in the season to aid Hostler also will return to the 49ers in some capacity

27 Dresses | 2 stars 27 Dresses was obviously written by the Chick Flick Plot Generator 2000 Sure it has a credited human screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna but how do we know she s not a robot The evidence is right there on the screen Every character is a prefabricated type starting with Jane (Katherine Heigl) the attractive successful hopelessly neurotic New Yorker with a personality flaw that keeps her from finding the right man In this case it s her inability to stand up for herself which manifests each time she agrees to be a bridesmaid/wedding planner for one of her friends (hence the 27 dresses) She s also in love with her blandly handsome boss (Edward Burns) but doesn t have the nerve to do anything about it despite constant encouragement from her sarcastic lush of a best friend (Judy Greer) The complications arise when Jane s sister (Malin Akerman) wins the heart of the boss and naturally asks Jane to be involved in the wedding As she frets about this disaster Jane catches the attention of Kevin (James Marsden) who writes the wedding column for a major newspaper despite being a total cynic about the institution He s also an annoying deceitful near-stalker but in movies like this that s supposed to be charming So is Jane s infatuation with marriage a common genre subtext that McKenna and director Anne Fletcher ( Step Up ) turn into glaring neon text (Which may be right up your aisle if you ve been planning your wedding since age 10 ) There s something admirable about their refusal to pretend the movie is about anything else forget the cute contrivances just head for the altar It s like that Wedding Story show with a plot and prettier couples Heigl has warmth and intelligence to go with her looks and she makes Jane seem like a grown-up with a brain even when the script doesn t want her to be Marsden s innate cuteness carries him further than it really should and very nearly compensates for the lack of chemistry with his co-star All of the actors are fine in fact and elevate 27 Dresses from excruciating to merely tolerable 27 DRESSES Director: Anne Fletcher Director: Anne Fletcher Cast: Katherine Heigl James Marsden Malin Akerman Rated: PG-13 for language some innuendo and sexuality Running time: 1:50

Wednesday January 2 2008 The 147 rushing yards Jacksonville s Fred Taylor piled up Dec 16 against the Steelers are the most by an opposing running back at Heinz Field and it stands to reason that he is excited to return to the stadium that he literally turned into his stomping grounds Well not so much "That field is terrible " Taylor said Tuesday during a conference call with Pittsburgh reporters "That s a lawsuit pending Maybe they should try and invest in some FieldTurf in the future " The Steelers hope Taylor likes the playing surface at Heinz Field even less if that s possible after Saturday night s AFC wild-card game story continues below Containing the 10-year veteran and fellow running back Maurice Jones-Drew will be paramount if the Steelers are to avenge an earlier loss to the Jaguars and advance in the playoffs The Jaguars rushed for 224 yards in their 29-22 win over the Steelers setting a Heinz Field record for most rushing yards by an opposing team Not that Taylor s pointed comments Tuesday reflected how successful the Jaguars were running the ball against the team that gave up the fewest yards in the NFL this season The playing surface at Heinz Field has come under fire this season and the Steelers addressed its condition by having it re-sodded in late November "If they re comfortable with that " Taylor said of the field "that s fine with them Myself personally I m more of a shifty back I like to try and make my cuts and that field doesn t allow for that so I would prefer FieldTurf or some good grass not just dirt " Asked if Taylor s dislike of the playing surface at Heinz Field is an advantage for the Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said "Sure it is if he feels that way I don t know anybody on our team who hates our field so I d have to say it s an advantage "

WASHINGTON Dec 30 (UPI) -- U S Sen John McCain R-Ariz Sunday defended the use of the term "phony" in his campaign advertising to describe GOP presidential rival Mitt Romney Romney a former governor of Massachusetts called the ad -- which included the "phony" designation used by the Concord Monitor in its editorial supporting McCain -- a "nasty" personal attack McCain appearing on ABC s "This Week with George Stephanopoulos " refrained from calling Romney a phony during the telecast but said Romney has switched positions on issues and it is OK to use what others have said about Romney in his advertising "I paid for the ad that put up the words of the respected newspapers here in the state of New Hampshire and I think that s perfectly appropriate " McCain said "I think he s a person who s changed his position on many issues and the voters know that and they ll decide that but that s what I will continue to quote from "McCain said his campaign is financially strong and he will not apply for federal matching funds unless the situation warrants it "I ve never run a campaign on money " he said "and here in New Hampshire and in South Carolina it s the retail politics at work and what wins elections not money " 2007 United Press International All Rights Reserved This material may not be reproduced redistributed or manipulated in any form

Fight! Fight! Fight! So uh heard about any upcoming elections of import The post-Christmas dash to the finish line for the Presidential nominations - or finish lines as things actually unfold - is on With abandon Given the multi-candidate field duking it out in a variety of states the race for the GOP nod has now devolved into a veritable blizzard of haymakers in all directions Now granted things aren t really rough yet But it s getting there and fast The bulk of the buzz and political coverage is around assorted TV ads so this long post is heavy on them Accordingly here are the most significant developments shaping the race for the next week leading up to the Iowa caucuses: 1) Mike Huckabee is running an unorthodox campaign After a couple weeks of not fighting back against the sea of attacks from fellow candidates and heightened scrutiny from the press he emerged out of the brief Christmas respite to air his same old "vote for me because I m a Christian" ad: The ad was indeed a great mass media introduction of Mike Huckabee to the Evangelical-heavy Iowa caucus-goer demographic Emphasis on was Now it just smells of "I need to hold my base intact because it ain t growing " But then just yesterday Huckabee s campaign unleashed two different ads to augment his rotation The first is an obvious effort to just play "Mr Nice " don t talk about the multitude of issues being brought to bear against him and essentially run out the clock asking the overly nice Iowans to vote for his overly nice personage: The 2nd ad is more bizarre: The spot is clearly designed to respond to the hits Huckabee has been taking on taxes and crime but the response - primarily via on-screen messaging - is overshadowed by the "Founding Fathers" dialogue from the candidate which makes little sense in the context of the current campaign dialogue More importantly if a candidate is going to respond to attacks against him he should either a) have a very solid direct comeback on the topic at hand or b) punch back hard on a different subject to change the conversation Huckabee is doing neither 2) Iowa appears to be tightening which makes Huckabee s focus even more peculiar The RealClearPolitics Iowa average shows Huckabee s lead down to the low-single digits down from a robust double-digit margin earlier in the month Moreover the three pollsters who have been in the field most often the last two months Strategic Vision Rasmussen and ARG show the gap shrinking from anywhere between a 6-13% Huckabee advantage down to only a 2% Huckabee margin and perhaps even a Romney lead in their latest surveys Forget the specific numbers (which are devilishly difficult to predict anyway) three regular pollsters showing the same trend is the story [UPDATE: since this post was originally composed two more polls from Zogby and Maxon Dixon have been added to the RealClearPolitics link above supporting the same trend Of course now we enter the closing days where last minute voter shifts can be volatile so take it all with a grain of salt] The race is tightening in part due to Huckabee s oblique strategy discussed above a steady spat of negative and/or mixed media stories the Club for Growth s continued hits on taxes and a steady stream of "contrast" ads from Mitt Romney Here s the latest: The astute reader will recognize that such "contrast" ads are pretty tame stuff in the world of politics but this is Iowa famous for its dislike of negative campaigns Note for example the negative information on Huckabee is conveyed by a soft gentle female voice Either way no candidate can hold their ground in the face of a well-funded onslaught without responding in some way Huckabee isn t quite doing that But 3) now a 3rd party group supporting Huck is responding for him "Trust Huck" is picking up the slack after a couple weeks of Huckabee taking punches This is a more classic attack ad complete with mocking laughter in the background: If any likely caucus goer finds that to be new information I d be surprised but it s another voice in the cacophony of political messaging that isn t hurting Huckabee at least (though note in the coverage provided at the link above that the ad buy is rather small) Now the candidate has to stop hurting himself 4) Huckabee wishes the caucuses were starting now ! Jonathan Martin has it right It increasingly looks like Huckabee has hit a peak and is trying to play keep-away with a shrinking lead Furthermore the candidate is causing a number of his own problems particularly on foreign policy If Mitt Romney has been teetering for months on the press running with a theme of "this guy is a phony " Mike Huckabee is now perilously close to the edge of a similar such precipice where the media starts saying "this guy doesn t know what he s talking about " Powerline summed up a series of foreign policy gaffes CNN got a Huckabee adviser admitting his candidate is flawed and John Bolton is now contradicting Huckabee s claims that he ever advised the candidate on foreign policy Needless to say this is not the kind of environment one wants before appearing on Meet the Press this coming Sunday 5) The Mitt v McCain war is on It was only a matter of time Anyone who saw the heavy sniping between the two campaigns prior to McCain s summertime implosion knew there was bad blood brewing With McCain gaining ground in New Hampshire in part thanks to Giuliani s slide a donnybrook was bound to happen It has Romney began the escalation after Christmas turning his on-the-campaign-trail barbs into another polite "contrast" ad: McCain rapidly went to DEFCON 1 with his response: The ad is interesting on a several levels One McCain calling Romney a phony is like Romney calling McCain a prick Both charges can be substantiated at least enough for a campaign ad But it s over the top given the current tone of the campaign debate Second McCain isn t actually responding on any of the issues for which he is being critiqued by Romney; probably because his campaign knows they don t have a good comeback on the merits Third the sourcing and content of the ad feed into a theme McCain s campaign is pushing either on purpose or inadvertently: "the media loves me " McCain s other current New Hampshire ad reeks of it: Pimping a candidate s newspaper endorsements to the campaign s advantage is of course a time-honored tradition But the feel of the later stages of this election cycle is increasingly beginning to revert to the media adoration of McCain that left a goodly number of Republicans feeling nauseous in 2000 For now Romney is punching right back at McCain Not quite as harshly but taking McCain s number one problem with likely Republican primary voters and laying it all out: Whatever happens in Iowa New Hampshire is going to be an absolute slugfest from January 4th - 8th 6) Romney has to win Iowa Sure there are ways he could still win the nomination if he doesn t Yet McCain is close enough now in New Hampshire - with the local media cheering him on - that it seems highly improbable Romney could absorb the inevitable press hit of finishing even a very close second in Iowa without losing the Granite State too With Huckabee s continued stumbles in recent weeks it increasingly looks like the winner of New Hampshire will be the favorite to win the nomination against Huckabee and his core of Evangelical voters into which he seems to be sequestering himself It won t be guaranteed but the winner of New Hampshire probably wins Michigan too That s a whole lot of mo heading into South Carolina Florida and beyond

Maimane Phiri Gallo Images Phiri sought a meeting with coach Gavin Hunt claiming he was not happy about sitting on the bench and at this stage of his career; he needed to be playing more than warming the bench and in addition needed clarity about his future at the Tshwane outfit Although no official word has come out of the Randburg offices of United it is an open secret that Hunt is not an admirer of Maimane and whatever emerges from their t te- -t te indications are that the coach will inform the left footed World Cup player that he does not feature in his plans Richard Rantjie the attacking midfielder is another player likely to be off-loaded and put on the transfer market as well as defender Isaac Mabotsa as Hunt attempts to reduce his squad to make way for possibly two additional players to strengthen the team for the challenge that lie ahead Hunt is reportedly considering recalling two strikers he signed at the start of the season but loaned both of them out to TUKS in the First Division George Maluleka and Dumisani Masilela for the final onslaught in the second round in an attempt to improve on their third position finish at the halfway mark United could pull off a surprise and become strong challengers if they secure the services of the two youngsters from TUKS and provided they maintain the same consistency they produced towards the end of the halfway mark But there are question marks hanging around top striker Katlego Mphela who is believed to be a target of Mamelodi Sundowns and does not really feature prominently in coach Gavin Hunt s plans Sunshine Press

------------------------------------------------------------
Thailand s Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for allies of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra to form a government rejecting legal challenges to their victory in last month s polls The People Power Party (PPP) which campaigned as Thaksin s political successor won general elections on December 23 but fell just shy of a majority of the 480 seats in parliament The party s victory was threatened by cases at the Supreme Court as well as dozens of vote fraud investigations before the Election Commission On Friday the court rejected the most important legal challenges including a charge filed by a rival politician accusing the PPP of being an illegal front for Thaksin After Thailand s military toppled Thaksin s government in September 2006 the deposed premier was barred from politics for five years and his once-dominant Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party disbanded The court also rejected charges that the PPP broke election law by distributing CDs featuring videos of Thaksin who has been living in exile since the coup Shortly after the court ruling the Election Commission announced that it had settled most of the vote fraud investigations and certified the wins of 460 of the 480 members of parliament That means the lower house will have enough members for a quorum to convene next week The PPP has already announced that it will unveil a six-party coalition government on Saturday leaving the rival Democrat Party alone in the opposition Surapong Suebwonglee the PPP s secretary general said he was relieved by the court s verdicts "We appreciate that the Supreme Court has delivered justice to us We were always optimistic that we would receive a fair trial " he said Chaiwat Sinsuwong the Democrat Party politician who filed the most important charges said he would consult with his lawyers on further legal action But the Democrat leadership has publicly repudiated his efforts prompting him to resign from the party The PPP still face several smaller legal challenges but those are seen as minor hurdles to forming a government that is widely expected to welcome back Thaksin from self-imposed exile in Britain The military already appears to be preparing for the PPP to take power with Thai media reporting intense behind-the-scenes jockeying by the generals to secure their own men in the key positions of army chief and defence minister "Obviously what the military are in the process of doing is protecting themselves" from any political retribution once Thaksin s allies are in power said Thai historian and analyst Chris Baker The military has already taken important steps to ensure its sway over the government An army-backed constitution -- approved in a referendum last year -- substantially weakens the prime minister while empowering the military and the bureaucracy The generals last month also pushed through a controversial security law that allows a military body with cabinet approval to suspend basic rights anywhere in the country at any time Under the PPP s new coalition some of the oldest and most controversial politicians in Thailand would take top positions in government The most likely choice for prime minister would be PPP leader Samak Sundaravej a 72-year-old right-winger linked to a horrific massacre of student protesters in 1976 He was also a deputy prime minister in May 1992 when troops again opened fire on pro-democracy protests against Thailand s last military government He has always denied any wrongdoing and has led a successful political career though he is still under investigation for corruption from his time as governor of Bangkok

Africa Speaks Forums Rasta Times US Crusade Trini View Books Iran: Who s Threatening Whom By Stephen Gowans January 13 2008gowans blogspot com It is very likely that a Pentagon video showing Iranian patrol boats confronting three US warships in the Strait of Hormuz was deliberately embellished to back up US president George Bush s efforts to enlist allies to confront Iran The video was released on the eve of Bush s departure on "a five-day five-country tour of the Arab world to build a common front to pressure Iran - which Mr Bush said was a threat to world peace - into ceasing its efforts to acquire nuclear technology " (1) There are a number of reasons to believe Iranian patrol boats did not provocatively confront US warships in international waters and that the evidence they did was "sexed up " to borrow a phrase used to describe Bush administration efforts to cherry pick evidence to fabricate a casus belli for its 2003 military conquest of Iraq Motive The release last month of a new National Intelligence Estimate that declares Iran to have abandoned a nuclear weapons program in 2003 has set back the efforts of the Bush administration to build an international coalition to confront Iran Washington has three reasons to pressure Iran 1 Iran is exercising a degree of independence from the US that does not suit the corporate and investment banking interests that dominate US foreign policy Economic independence removes Iran from the territory US capital is free to unconditionally exploit Washington s ultimate goal is regime change in which the current government in Tehran would be replaced by a comprador government beholden to the US in keeping with the accustomed US imperialist practice of dominating other countries through local elites With a Western-oriented regime in Tehran tariffs and restrictions on foreign investment would be lifted and state-owned enterprises would be sold off This would benefit the profit-making interests of US firms investment banks and American hereditary capitalist families 2 Countries which are weak economically and dependent on foreign sources of critical economic inputs are readily manipulated to serve the interests of the owners and managers of income-producing properties - the bankers corporate executives corporate lawyers and major investors who make up the US ruling class The development in Iran of a domestic nuclear power industry and reliance on domestic supplies of uranium would strengthen Iran economically and make the country more self-reliant An Iran that imported enriched uranium from outside its borders - a "compromise" proposal put forward by Russia and Europe - would leave the country vulnerable to economic blackmail and under the thumb of foreign powers It is for this reason that the Iranian state insists on being able to control the enrichment of Iran s plentiful uranium 3 The development of an independent self-reliant domestic nuclear industry would furnish Iran with the capability of producing nuclear weapons a potential it could exercise to deter US aggression From the point of view of the US foreign policy establishment this amounts to the very real threat of self-defense an intolerable development to an establishment that relies on force and the threat of force to outrage the sovereignty of other countries With Russia and China veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council opposed to highly punitive sanctions against Iran the Bush administration has been pressuring its allies to apply their own trade and investment sanctions Many allies especially those with economic stakes in Iran are reluctant to comply with Washington s demands For these countries the pain of sanctions goes two ways With the National Intelligence Estimate impugning the administration s case the pressure on US allies has diminished To generate new pressure the US administration has been looking for opportunities to convey the message that Iran continues to pose a threat; hence Bush s week-long tour of the Middle East It appears all too convenient that the incident in the Strait of Hormuz occurred on the eve of Bush s mission to enlist support for a renewed push to confront Iran Deception The most dramatic part of the evidence the Pentagon used to underline the US president s case against Iran was the audio portion of the videotape In heavily accented English a voice - presumably belonging to one of the Iranian sailors -- warns: "I am coming at you - you will explode in a couple of minutes " The audio recorded separately from the video was stitched together with scenes of Iranian patrol boats manoeuvring around US warships The Pentagon acknowledges that it can t say the words originated from one of the patrol boats Indeed the absence in the audio of ambient sound -- wind waves and the growl of outboard motors - makes the initial implication of the Pentagon video -- that the threat came from the patrol boats -- rather unlikely The Iranians were travelling in open speedboats The wind waves and engine sounds would have been heard in the background The fact that the Pentagon used audio it now acknowledges is of uncertain origin to embellish its video (and video being easily doctored cannot nowadays be taken as compelling evidence of anything) calls to mind the Gulf of Tonkin incident To win support for stepping up war in Vietnam the Johnson administration concocted a story about two US warships the Maddox and Turner Joy coming under attack from North Vietnamese naval forces It was pure fiction Pattern Contriving evidence to support aggression whether military subversive or economic is part of a practice that recurs in US foreign policy with a regularity that makes the practice institutional Grand deceptions to justify war from the false allegations of genocide in Kosovo to contrived intelligence of banned weapons in Iraq are not symptoms of the moral weakness of high state officials but are part of a regular pattern of the US state shaping public opinion to the demands of its aggressive and expansionary foreign policy The threats the Bush administration have already made against Iran and the economic warfare it has already waged are themselves justified by concocted evidence Over the last few years the principal justification the US has invoked to rattle its sabre against Iran is the need to deter Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons weapons Washington claims Iran seeks to wipe Israel off the map The evidence that Iran is secretly building nuclear weapons - now discredited by the latest National Intelligence Estimate - is based on an earlier 2005 National Intelligence Estimate That estimate declared with high confidence that Iran had a nuclear weapons program The latest estimate declares also with high confidence that Iran didn t have a nuclear weapons program in 2005 If the latest assessment is true the intelligence community could not have had high confidence in its positive assessment in 2005 Significantly sections of the 2005 estimate were written by the same team that "sexed up" the intelligence on Iraq s non-existent weapons of mass destruction The 2005 conclusions according to intelligence sources interviewed by the New York Times were "thinly sourced" and "based on somewhat murky knowledge of Iran s capabilities and the goals of its leaders " (2) In other words the evidence was concocted to fit a pre-conceived conclusion one needed to justify an aggressive posture toward Iran The other part of the claim that Iran represents a threat - that the Iranian president is a vicious Jew-hater on the order of Hitler who seeks to destroy Israel in a hail of nuclear missiles - originates in a deliberate misrepresentation of Ahmadinejad s words The Iranian president s wish to wipe Israel off the map is metaphorical He supports a bi-national one person-one vote state in ex-British mandate Palestine the territory comprising Israel the West Bank and Gaza Strip Were such a state to succeed Israel - something Ahmadinejad believes is inevitable - Israel a Jewish state based on the theft of the land and property of the indigenous Palestinian population would figuratively disappear from the map Anyone willing to work to help the Palestinians reclaim the territory they were dispossessed of is quite naturally a threat to Israel This accounts for Israel s hysterical reaction to the Iranian president Israeli state officials however do not for a moment believe that were Iran to acquire nuclear weapons it would launch a nuclear first strike That is a convenient fabrication used to justify an aggressive posture toward Iran Inverting reality While US state officials and the mimetic Western media shape public opinion to the view that Iran is a threat the reality is quite different To see this consider the thought experiment conducted by British journalist Neil Clark Clark announced on his blog that Tehran had called upon the world to confront the US because US Navy patrol ships had harassed Iranian warships off the coast of Florida Of course there are no Iranian warships off the coast of Florida but there are US warships - dozens of them - off the coast of Iran If the Iranian patrol ships had truly been as provocative as the Pentagon says the threat they posed would have been miniscule compared to the infinitely larger threat the US poses to Iran Washington has been dangling a military sword of Damocles over the heads of millions of Iranians for years allegedly because Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program The real reason is because the officers of the Iranian ship of state refuse to steer in the direction the US admiralty demands With a protectionist economy that features oodles of state-owned enterprises and which therefore denies US capital coveted export and investment opportunities Iran has long been on Washington s (economic) regime change radar screen Washington is willing to threaten millions of Iranians to get its way all for the profits of corporate America not least those of US oil Who s really threatening whom NOTES:1 Globe and Mail January 11 2008 2 New York Times December 5 2007 Source: http://gowans blogspot com/2008/01/iran-whos-threatening-whom html Homepage | U S Crusade | Analysis and Reasoning | Zimbabwe | Venezuela Back to Top

The move means Baathists can rejoin the Iraqi army US President George W Bush has praised a new law in Iraq that will allow former members of Saddam Hussein s Baath party to return to public life Mr Bush called it an important step towards national reconciliation The Baath party formed mainly from Iraq s Sunni minority was declared illegal after the US-led invasion of the country in 2003 The US had been urging Iraq s Shia-led government to approve the move in a bid to reach out to minority Sunni Arabs The new law will allow thousands of former party members to apply for reinstatement in the civil service and military "It s an important step toward reconciliation it s an important sign that the leaders of that country understand that they must work together to meet the aspirations of the Iraqi people " said Mr Bush The president was speaking in Bahrain the latest stage in a tour of the Middle East Earlier in Kuwait he said hope was returning to Iraq "Iraq is now a different place from one year ago We must do all we can to ensure that 2008 will bring even greater progress " Mr Bush said Reconciliation Saddam Hussein s regime was predominantly Sunni and many figures were removed from government after his fall in 2003 under an edict from ex-US administrator Paul Bremer WHO ARE THE BAATHISTS The party was the political instrument of Saddam Hussein s rule An estimated 2 5 million Iraqis were party members Banned and broken up by US administrator in May 2003 Baathism was a pan-Arab secular nationalist movement Error put right amid concerns Bush tour diary The army was disbanded thousands of teachers university lecturers and civil servants were sacked The initiative based on the de-Nazification of Germany after World War II banned anyone who had been a member of the higher tiers of the party from government employment Some were reinstated after the US found that it had cleared out key ministries and the military without having any replacements After the Americans handed over power to an Iraqi government in 2004 they urged the Shia-led administration to ease the measures further in an effort to promote national reconciliation Much of the Sunni insurgency is thought to be centred on dismissed military men from the Baathist regime Heavy blow The new legislation - called the Accountability and Justice Law - was approved on Saturday by all 143 lawmakers present in the 275-member house Saddam Hussein s Baath party was predominantly Sunni It creates a three-month period for the ex-members to be challenged after which they will be immune from prosecution over the Saddam era The law excludes former Baath members charged with crimes or still sought for them However it will grant state pensions to many former Baathist employees even if they are not given new posts The BBC s Humphrey Hawksley in Baghdad says the legislation is seen as an attempt by the government to end the sectarian divide between the Shia and Sunni communities But almost five years on after much bloodshed it is unclear how many former Baathists will take up the offer to get their jobs back our correspondent adds A spokeswoman for the US embassy in Baghdad told Reuters news agency that the new law showed "the political process is working in Iraq" HAVE YOUR SAY Finally some common sense is surfacing after years of darkness Sal NYC Send us your comments Meanwhile Mr Bush said there had been a dramatic improvement in the country since the US troop "surge" last year - when 30 000 extra soldiers were sent to the Baghdad area He added that US and Iraqi soldiers had dealt "heavy blows" to al-Qaeda and that the country was "now a different place from one year ago" He said the withdrawal of 20 000 troops by July was on track but no decision had been taken to bring home more

Shuttle s ambitious itinerary causes doubt With six launches slated this year experts fear trouble for astronauts space program Article Launched: 01/06/2008 03:15:25 AM PST WASHINGTON -- NASA s plan to double the number of space shuttle flights it launches this year in an effort to speed up final assembly of the international space station has stoked concern among independent experts that the space agency is placing scheduling demands on the 27-year-old fleet similar to those that contributed to the Challenger and Columbia disasters NASA has scheduled six shuttle launches this year -- twice the number of flights it managed in each of the past two years but that plan has already been complicated by the grounding of the shuttle Atlantis as the result of a recurring electrical problem Although NASA has many new safety procedures in place as a result of the Columbia accident the schedule has raised fears that the space agency driven by budgetary and political considerations might again find itself tempting fate with the shuttles which some say were always too high-maintenance for the real world of space flight NASA officials say they remain confident that the three spacecraft will complete their schedule of 13 flights by the time the shuttle program is scheduled to shut down in September 2010 Officials also say they will finish assembly of the space station which they say will be a historic achievement for mankind William Gerstenmaier who has been with the shuttle program since its inception and is now NASA s chief of space operations acknowledges that flying the shuttles has driven home time and again just how difficult Advertisement it is to send men and women into space Nonetheless he said that despite their age the shuttles are safer now than ever because NASA has learned so much more about flying them The orbiters themselves remain in good shape Gerstenmaier said and the fleet -- which has flown 120 missions -- could continue flying beyond 2010 but for financial and logistical considerations imposed by the effort to build a new generation of spacecraft The shuttle cannot fly beyond low Earth orbit and President Bush has called for a renewed effort to explore the moon and later Mars "The schedule we ve made is very achievable in the big scheme of things " Gerstenmaier said of the remaining flights "That is unless we get some unforeseen problems " The history of the program however is filled with such problems -- from a rare and damaging hailstorm at the Kennedy Space Center last year to the shedding of foam insulation that led to the destruction of Columbia and its crew in 2003 The 2 1/2-year hiatus in launches that followed that disaster has already reduced the number of missions scheduled to the space station and as a result several important and expensive instruments built for it -- including one that cost European researchers $1 5 billion -- now have no way to get into space "This pressure feels so familiar " said Alex Roland a professor at Duke University and a former NASA historian "It was the same before the Challenger and Columbia disasters -- this push to do more with a spaceship that is inherently unpredictable because it is so complex " The shuttle s complexity is undisputed and proudly proclaimed on the NASA Web site With room for seven astronauts a large cargo bay and airplane-like wings that allow it to glide back to Earth for landing the shuttle can do much more than any other spacecraft in history But that complexity has also made it subject to innumerable mechanical problems and weather delays -- the kind that seldom trouble the Russian Soyuz program As Gerstenmaier described it the Soyuz capsules can easily be launched in winds and other weather that would keep the shuttle earthbound and they float back to Earth under parachutes like the earlier Apollo capsules The panel that investigated the 2003 Columbia disaster addressed the issue of complexity and concluded it made the shuttle inherently experimental and risky As a result some want to see the shuttle grounded as soon as possible Panel member John Logsdon a space policy analyst at George Washington University said another fatal space failure must be avoided at all costs both for the potential loss of life and because it would most likely end the manned space program for years to come "Every time we launch a shuttle we risk the future of the human space flight program " he said "The sooner we stop flying this risky vehicle the better it is for the program " The problem currently grounding Atlantis involves four backup fuel sensors at the bottom of the massive external tank that carries the shuttle s super-cooled hydrogen fuel In December NASA twice scrapped scheduled launches of Atlantis because the sensors were malfunctioning and late last month engineers took some of the parts out of the tank and sent them to another NASA facility for analysis Officials said last week that they were almost certain they knew what was going wrong and penciled in Jan 24 as the first possible day for Atlantis to fly But they said they doubted the sensor problem would be fully resolved by then and were more confident that the fuel tank would be fully operational by early February At that point however the shuttle would run into a different problem -- a Russian Progress cargo ship is scheduled to dock at the space station on Feb 7 and only one spaceship can dock at a time Further delays for Atlantis could be the result Gerstenmaier said that despite these obstacles it is entirely possible for NASA to launch six shuttle flights in 2008 He pointed to a five-month period in 2007 when three launches went off trouble-free as an indication of what was possible absent unforeseen problems And while the mechanical weather and logistical delays have proved costly and time-consuming Gerstenmaier said they also have had a silver lining: They have provided years of invaluable experience in fixing problems on the run that will pay large dividends in future space travel NASA is also facing growing political pressure to keep the shuttles flying beyond 2010 especially from lawmakers who represent NASA workers who could lose their jobs after the shuttle program ends Thirty-two members of the Texas congressional delegation sent a letter to President Bush last month asking for at least one additional shuttle flight and Rep Dave Weldon R-Fla introduced a bill that would provide funding to speed up construction of the new spacecraft while requiring the shuttle to continue flying to the space station until 2013

Harry Redknapp out of Newcastle running By Patrick Nathanson and agencies Last Updated: 11:11am GMT 10/01/2008 Have your say Read comments Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp has denied speculation linking him with the vacant managerial position at St James Park Redknapp had been the favourite to replace Sam Allardyce who was sacked yesterday afternoon after an indifferent start to the season No go: Harry Redknapp will stay at Portsmouth However he expressed his satisfaction with his life down on the south coast which he was unwilling to swap for the intense pressure that would come with managing English football s sleepiest of giants "I really do not know anything about this I have not spoken to anyone from Newcastle " said Redknapp "When I saw Sam had left my immediate thoughts were that Alan Shearer was a certainty to take over "There s nothing in my being linked with the job I had an offer not so long ago to take over at what I consider a massive club but I didn t go "I am happy down on the south coast " Earlier Redknapp s brother-in-law Frank Lampard Snr played down the link with Newcastle saying that Redknapp who has never managed north of London would be unlikely to take the job at St James Park Redknapp s rejection will add to the woes of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley after former striker and fans favourite Alan Shearer also appeared to drop out of the running for the job According to the BBC Shearer is happy with his role as a Match of the Day pundit However Ashley could turn to former Tottenham manger Martin Jol who has snubbed the offer of an interview at Fulham and turned down the chance to manage PSV Eindhoven in the hope of taking charge at one of the Premier League s big clubs Have your say Related articles 10 January 2008: had been the favourite to replace Sam Allardyce Comments What a marvellous opportunity for Allardyce He now has a bit of money and he can further develop his career abroad Learn more styles of play in the Italian German and Spanish leagues and come back in 6 or 7 years ready to manage England He will be of greater experience and more rounded in the European style He will be ready to combine English bull dog spirit and suave continental mentality England should win the lot with that combination The same applies to other "struggling" English managers I doubt many will think that way and that is why none are fit for the England job Posted by Idealist on January 10 2008 5:58 PM Report this comment Harry lives in a large house in a prime position in one of the most expensive areas of real estate on the planet No way was he (let alone Mrs Redknapp)ever going to want to move 350 miles north to Tyneside and anyway didn t he say Pompey was his "spiritual home" Newcastle must be barking mad to change managers with the frequency they do The money they waste on changing managers and players is staggering even by football s dubious standards I can only assume the Newcastle board has already sounded out someone -

RAMALLAH West Bank Dec 5 (AP) Mahmoud Abbas the Palestinian president will ask foreign donors to provide $5 8 billion in aid through 2010 nearly double the current level Mr Abbas says he needs help with a huge deficit run up in years of strife but he is also promising to curb spending and stimulate economic growth The Abbas government will give its development plan for 2008 through 2010 to officials from donor countries in Paris on Friday before a high-level donor meeting there on Dec 17 Seventy percent of the aid is to be used for continuing operating expenses including $120 million a month for wages for public employees Thirty percent is to be spent on development projects The government hopes to decrease its deficit gradually stimulate the economy including private investment and to become less and less dependent on aid said Samir Abdullah the Palestinian planning minister Our ultimate goal is to end economic stagnation he said holding out hope for a balanced budget in six years perhaps sooner if Israel moves fast to lift restrictions on trade and travel The Paris conference is meant to build on the momentum from the Middle East conference last week in Annapolis Md where Mr Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel pledged to resume peace talks and aim for an agreement by the end of 2008 However the Palestinians are submitting a steep aid request amid considerable donor fatigue Since the mid-1990s foreign donors led by Europe have sent billions of dollars to the Palestinian territories to support peace efforts but gains were largely wiped out in Israeli-Palestinian fighting Critics also charge that large sums went to corrupt officials in previous governments The decision by some nations to impose sanctions after the parliamentary election victory in 2006 by the militant Islamic group Hamas worsened the economic slide as money was shifted from development projects to payments for welfare benefits In June Hamas seized Gaza ousting Mr Abbas s troops and Israel and Egypt virtually closed the territory s borders The Abbas government governing from the West Bank said it hoped to open a new chapter with the three-year plan We are determined to bring an end to internal chaos and poverty and the occupation that continues to aggravate this situation the report said in a reference to the Israeli occupation We are determined to reverse the impact of decades of conflict and de-development the report said It was unclear how much Gaza would benefit from foreign aid The three-year plan commits only to providing humanitarian assistance and basic services until Gaza s borders reopen presumably once Hamas is no longer in power there Under the current arrangement Mr Abbas s government pays the salaries of 31 000 civil servants in Gaza who do not cooperate with Hamas and covers Gaza s utility bills Israelis Kill 2 Hamas Members JERUSALEM Dec 5 Israeli forces on Wednesday killed two members of Hamas and wounded four others as they prepared to fire a mortar shell into Israel and killed at least one Palestinian security officer in Bethlehem after Israeli forces in civilian clothing were fired upon as they tried to carry out an arrest raid Israeli forces have killed 32 Palestinians in the past 10 days Since January Palestinians have fired over 2 000 rockets and mortar shells toward Israel from Gaza Israel said
